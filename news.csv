2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:47Z,Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool: Premier League – live reaction,"There’s a thousand-yard stare from Vitor Pereira as his coaches discuss where it all went wrong. The truth is Forest didn’t see it out. Liverpool’s players are delighted, with Ibrahima Konate whelping in delight. VAR lightning didn’t strike twice for Alexis Mac Allister. What late drama in a game that was going nowhere. Nottingham Forest will rue a first half where they could not score. Liverpool were poor until they brought on Rio Ngumoha. 90+8 min: There’s a VAR check. A long look. Aina had played Van Dijk onside. Pereira is incandescent with rage. Mac Allister has his goal. Didn’t even need his backside to break his duck. A long throw chance for Joe Gomez. The ball comes out, Szoboszlai’s ball in, Van Dijk’s header and Mac Allister bundles in after Ortega knocks it out… 90+5 min: Mac Allister has not scored all season, waiting for one off his backside, and when he did, it was denied by VAR. 90+3 min: Some confusion over how many minutes have been added on. Nobody knows anything. Think seven minutes were added. Sangare has a dig from distance. And why not? 90+1 min: That would have been the weirdest goal of the season. But the rules dictate that cannot stand. The roar from the Forest fans was so loud as Anthony Taylor, briefly, became the darling of West Bridgford. 90 min: But here’s VAR. Did the ball strike the arm? Yes, it did. The elbow. So no goal. Oh lordy. Where did that come from from? Ngumoha forces the ball in, and then Ekitike heads at Ortega, a fine save, and as Aina tries to clear, Mac Allister challenges and the ball balloons in. Bizarre…. 88 min: Lucca nods the corner back but Ndoye’s shot is blocked. Instead, Liverpool try to attack and Chiesa is squeezed off. Gomez can launch another long throw. Forest deal well enough with that. 87 min: Gomez knocks behind as Ndoye chases a ball across the penalty area. Forest win a corner, and then another in quick succession. 86 min: Oof! Close! The closest. Alisson mishandles a ball from Ndoye, and it drops to Gibbs-White. His shot grubs off the floor and then Sangare smashes wide. 85 min: Liverpool in Forest territory and Ortega flicks away a Gomez throw flicked on by Van Dijk. Forest more penned in now, looking to the counterattack. 83 min: Feels like a while since any actual football was played here. Andy Robertson is coming on for Liverpool, for Kerkez, who has done OK. Joe Gomez comes on for Curtis Jones to sit in the Spinal Tap drummer’s stool. 81 min: Kevin McManus gets in touch: “When Ekitike is having an off day like today our forward line is innocuous. We love Salah for everything he has done for us but there has been a massive drop-off since latter part of last season. Gakpo baffles me. Apparently the data says differently but I have never seen what he brings. Going to need a header from Virgil or another screamer from Dominik.” That’s about the size of it.. 80 min: Latest score: Sunderland 1-2 Fulham (Enzo La Fee) A goal here feels unlikely. Both teams not finding it, instead they are grinding it. 78 min: Forest changes: Anderson for Dominguez, Jesus for Lucca. Liverpool changes: Salah goes off, it’s been a miserable afternoon, as does Gakpo, and on come Chiesa and Ngumoha. Salah was not happy at all. Slot cannot have been happy with him. 75 min: Les Lagan gets in touch: “I always thought Stanley Park - quite a large field - was in the Anfield Road area.” Is a park a field? Answers on a postcard to… Rod Wooden gets in touch: “John, for me the player that Liverpool have missed most this season is Luis Díaz, who never seems to be mentioned in this particular discussion. Maybe I’m only saying this because I live in Colombia, but their attack this season has lost its sparkle, and he provided it.” David Wall enters the chat: “Perhaps it’s a sign that we need more critical thinking taught in schools but i don’t understand why Slot having won with a team built by Klopp is a criticism of Slot. After all, Klopp didn’t win with that same team, he could only manage them to third. So if Slot achieved more with the same resources that implies he’s out-performed Klopp. “Perhaps you can argue that team building is also part of managing, and to an extent that’s true. But the main skill in management is making the best use of your resources, whatever they happen to be That’s why the manager-of-the-year awards don’t always go to the manager of the champions but sometimes to the manager of the team that has most out-performed what would be expected given their budget. And in that respect Slot did better than Klopp comparing them over the previous two seasons.” 73 min: Forest are sat deep as Liverpool attempt to thread passes. This is where Wirtz might come in handy. As it is, he’s sat in the stand having missed out with an as yet unspecified problem. 71 min: Salah goes on a run, bumps into Williams and then gives up on the ball. That was not good. That was not the Salah we have known for so long. 70 min: Konate is penalised for smashing into Jesus. Then Jesus is penalised for fouling the same player. It’s bitty, but at last opens up, and Bakwa has space and time. Too much, it turns out, and he drags his shot wide. 68 min: It’s ebbing away, this game. Feels like one goal wins it, though the defences are very much on top. 66 min: An ironic smile on the face of Mohamed Salah, after he gets no change from a clash with Neco Williams. Two Forest changes: Ndoye on for Hudson-Odoi while Hutchinson is replaced by Bakwa. 64 min: Aina’s cross briefly looks as if it might end up in the net, but drifts over to Liverpool’s relief. Latest score: Sunderland 0-2 Fulham (Raul Jimenez) Jimenez scored in the earlier game this season between the team. What a job Marco Silva is doing, by the way. 63 min: Slot still looks annoyed on the sideline. Vitor Pereira is in perpetual motion. This game is fully in the balance. 61 min: News from Crystal Palace, where Ladislav Krejci of Wolves has been red-carded for a second yellow. It’s still 0-0. 59 min: Liverpool now pressing high, too. Forest getting far less time on the ball.l Latest score: Sunderland 0-1 Fulham (Jimenez, 54) 58 min: Much better from Liverpool who are now controlling possession in the manner that would be expected. The game has slowed down a little, too, which may be to Arne Slot’s tastes. 57 min: On second glance that’s a fine save from Ortega, and made harder by the outbreak of actual sun in the Nottingham area. 55 min: Salah does well to direct the ball back to Jones and Ortega is asked to make a snap save. 54 min: Some noise from the Liverpool fans. The fields of Anfield Road are sung for. It’s been a long time since there were actual fields in the Anfield Road area. 52 min: Liverpool at least look as if they intend to attack in this half. Konate releases Mac Allster who gets his shot blocked. 50 min: Milenkovic loses the ball when he is back defending to Salah but there are no consequences. Salah can do nothing with the ball. 49 min: Ekitike clears the corner as first man. The set pieces have not been good in this game. Milenkovic heads over from Hudson-Odoi’s cross that wasn’t quite the right angle for the big defender. 47 min: Liverpool force a corner, their first. It soon results in a second. Forest struggle to clear that but eventually Hutchinson comes away and wins a Forest corner. 46 min: N0 changes at half-time. Jamie Carragher, on Sky’s broadcast, has called that “one of the worst halves I have seen from Liverpool all season”. That’s saying something. Tony Barr gets in touch: “Not sure how much Slot had a say in the transfers, but let’s play this out: “Trent leaves on a free was definitely up to him. Not much LFC can do if a player decides they want to play for Los Blancos for truckload of Euros. Arne, would you like the best striker in the PL, other than Halaand? Hmm let me think about that…Arne would you like Germany’s generational attacking pkahmaking talent? Hmmm let me think about that. ”Hindsight is 20:20. The best time for renewal is when things are going well. I’d rather look at the gamble taken to not to fully bolster the central defence or not find a fledgling replacement for Mo…” Ian Copestake gets back in touch: “We might see a sub subbed at halftime with Gomez coming on for Jones. Then the rightback curse will rub its hands again.” And from Brian Kitt: “Freddie Woodman on the bench for Liverpool sounds like he could tell the Forest for the trees.” Liverpool have two goalies on the bench for some reason. Dave Estherby gets in touch: “I think it’s interesting that the whole, “Slot won with Klopp’s team” thing only started at the beginning of this season after a pretty disastrous summer in the transfer market; Letting (one of) your best player(s) leave for free and not replacing him, being sold an absolute pup by Newcastle, not recognizing the captain’s race is run, not getting a better backup for an injury-prone goalkeeper and finally, well, Florian Wirtz. Slot had at least a hand in all these decisions.” Nottingham Forest 0-0 Liverpool Crystal Palace 0-0 Wolves Sunderland 0-0 Fulham It’s the best league in the world, don’t you know? It’s been bad from Liverpool, good from Forest, so Liverpool ought to be relieved while Forest must be frustrated. They have been excellent in all but the scoring goals and creating proper chances discipline. A word for Liverpool’s defenders, who have been put through quite the workload but held firm. 45+3 min: Milenkovic launches one over the bar, and that should be the end of the action for the first 45. 45+2 min: Some loud screams from the bench? Slot or Pereira? You decide. 45+1 min: Three minutes were added on. Liverpool are about to feel the lash of the Slot tongue in the dressing room. In midfield an attack, they have been not much short of dreadful. 45 min: Forest push on for the goal their first half deserves. Liverpool’s defenders deserve some credit for their good work. Anderson gets chance to shoot but drifts his attempt over the bar. Pereira is full of angst once more. 43 min: Another timely block, this time from Szoboszlai, as Gibbs-White tries to shoot. The one-way traffic continues. But the corner is again a waste. Will Forest live to regret this? 41 min: Alisson is forced to tip behind when Hutchinson scoops in a cross. Corner ball. This one goes deep and the danger recedes for now. Jesus misdirects his header when the ball comes back in. 40 min: Van Dijk has made a goal saving intervention just when Igor Jesus shaped to shoot. Vitor Pereira throws his head back in angst. 39 min: Ian Copestake gets in touch: “May the Liverpool players never have days off before a game. They still seem to be on a beach.” Thought the same of Chelsea’s Dubai crew on Saturday. Tim Woods did too: “No radio commentary of the game in Germany, and a lot of pubs have stopped showing English games due to the cost. So I am gratefully following your updates, with Berlin radio helping the afternoon along; outings for Roxette, Alphaville and even Johnny Hates Jazz so far!” Shattered dreams. 38 min: Gravenberch rages when he’s penalised for fouling Anderson. This is a frustrated Liverpool team. 36 min: Salah gets chance to cross. And it’s awful. His descent this season has been uncomfortable to watch. 35 min: Forest still looking for that golden moment. Perhaps inviting on Liverpool can open up space. Hugo Ekitike – forgot he was playing. 34 min: Another loose Salah touch – he’s not had many touches at all – and Sangare takes the ball off him. 32 min: Van Dijk has taken another blow to the head, after Igor Jesus clatters the ball into his face. Curtis Jones been shifted to right-back, it seems. With Szoboszlai to midfield. 30 min: It’s been a poor half hour from Liverpool but they remain level. 28 min: Florian Wirtz, in fetching woolly hat, is sat in the stands. Liverpool all at sea as Alisson has to skid out of goal to prevent a corner as Konate dallies. The long throw is not good, a waste of a situation. 26 min: Lovely piece of control from Anderson, who kills a high ball stone dead with w waft of his boot. Forest have some good players, and Anderson leads the list. 25 min: Gibbs-White is fouled by Konate, whose considerable bulk lands on his victim’s foot in the aftermath. An accident but that will bruise. 24 min: Kari Tulinius gets in touch: “Early days and all that, but Vitor Pereira’s Trees seem like a trickier side to play against than Dyche’s. There’s a lot more closing down of opponents with the ball, and attacks are more frenetic. On the whole they run a lot more. Difficult to play against, but given the added workload of European football, which Pereira didn’t have with Wolves, I imagine that Forest will tire after a few weeks of this.” 23 min: Fair to say Wirtz is being missed? Forest continue to be all over Liverpool who cannot keep hold of the ball at the moment. 21 min: Hudson-Odoi is to the fore, as he has been all game. Can Forest make something of their dominance of possession? Hutchinson at least tests Alisson but his shot is something of a pea-roller. No trouble for the great man. 20 min: The referee, Anthony Taylor, is not a popular man in Nottingham, from experience. “It’s all about you” is one song they sing. 19 min: A delegation around the ball. Taken short and Murillo smashes with his left peg. The Liverpool wall holds firm and then Gakpo does some decent defensive work. Gibbs-White is booked for not retreating from a free-kick. 17 min: More defending to do for Liverpool. Murillo has a shot blocked, and then Van Dijk and Anderson clash heads, which brings the game to a temporary halt. Both are OK. Forest have a free-kick after Igor Jesus was fouled. 16 min: A Mr Keet gets in touch: “I get really bored of the “Klopp’s team” thing, and the idea in general that managers are responsible for “building” teams. Klopp and Slot, and managers of most other big teams, are part of a recruitment team and, typically, won’t have the final say on transfers (just an input.) Yes, slot benefitted from inheriting a good side, and one that had been well coached by klopp. He then had to manage them and coach them for an entire season in order to win the league. Take training, set the tactics, motivate the team.” 14 min: Jeremy Boyce gets in touch: “I can’t help seeing this fixture without hearing the echoes of the terrible events at Hillsborough in 1989, when these two, at that time, giants of the English game briefly clashed before the tragedy at the Leppings Lane end. Much water has flowed under the bridges of the Trent and Mersey since then and the two have enjoyed vastly differing fortunes. Never mind whether Slot won the League with Jurgen’s team, what is clear to see is that Liverpool have always prioritised continuity in the dug out, whereas.... Does Pereira understand what and who he’s taking on within his own club, never mind the oppos on the pitch ? Another new manager, another new style ? We’re about to find out...” 13 min: The weapon of choice was a training round routine that Forest hurriedly beat away. 12 min: Gakpo passes the ball into open space, a no look, no clue pass, and Forest can go again. They too lose position and Sangare fouls Gravenberch. Is this in Szoboszlai’s range? 11 min: Anderson strides forward and shoots just wide. Forest are all over Liverpool at the moment. 10 min: Aina sets off on a give and go, and is knocked over by Mac Allister. The free-kick is a long way out. And taken short, Van Dijk heads the eventual cross away. There are claims that Gibbs-White was fouled by Gravenberch but nothing doing, not even on VAR. 8 min: Sangare is asked to shoot by the home fans but Forest hold on to the ball. They’ve been good so far. Liverpool are struggling with their zest. 7 min: The corner is low and a waster, not beating the first man. Pereira reaches for his notebook. 6 min: Anderson’s ball to Hudson-Odoi sees Konate come across to clean up, and a corner results, Forest’s first. 5 min: Gakpo, who seems ever all but ever present, chases the ball down the channels. When Salah gets chance to make an incursion, his touch is loose. As it often is these days, sadly. 3 min: Pressure put on Virgil van Dijk gives Forest a glimmer, and then the ball comes back to Forest. Hudson-Odoi takes the ball down, shoots and Alisson comes to the rescue. That was close. It could have been much better than close. 2 min: Liverpool settle into some early possession. It’s loud at the City Ground which is louder these days than it often was in days of yore. 1 min: Curtis Jones is in midfield, Szoboszlai lines up at right-back. Forest are going for a league double over Liverpool. It’s been a strange old season for them. Footage of Wirtz does not suggest serious injury, but he told the coaches he could not play. Will Curtis Jones now play right-back? Vitor Pereira is applauded as he walks out for the first half. Nottingham Forest fans are rather too used to this type of thing by now. Curtis Jones steps in, after an injury in the warm-up. Or so we think. It may be sickness. Eric Peterson gets in touch: “I wouldn’t mind Wayne Rooney pulling on an old Everton kit and getting on some podcast to remind Arne Slot, “Easy there, sport. You say that the only thing you and Jurgen Klopp have in common is that you both won the league. That’s not true. You both won the league with Jurgen’s team. Whether you can build a champion of your own is a different question.” Arne Slot just spoke to Sky, starting with Dominik Szoboszlai at full-back: “He needs to be because that’s what we need. We have our issues, especially in defence. Missing our 2 fullbacks, but Dominic has done that job really well. Last week, Curtis Jones, did his job really well. So that’s the good thing about midfielders, they are usually able to play in more positions than only in the midfields. “A little bit of a different challenge. because a manager head coach has impact on playing style, but in the end, they’re still the same players. And I think they have a lot of quality players. “Sometimes games can be equal on set pieces and then other parts of the game are also important. But as I said so many times, it’s very, very, very hard to win a game of football if you concede more set-pieces than you score. So that’s why it just has always been an important part of the game. But that is even increased even more this season.” Matt Dony gets in touch: “I hope Neco Williams has a great game, and all Liverpool’s goals(!) come down the other flank. I really thought he’d be the successor to TAA, and he’d be a superstar for Wales. He’s obviously very good, can be a really lovely footballer to watch, but just never quite became what we were hoping. The difference between ‘good’ and ‘great’ is such a fine line in so many ways, but a yawning chasm in others.” Vitor Pereira is currently sat on his own in the Forest dugout but spoke to Sky Sports, starting with that big win at Fenerbahce: “It was special mentally. The team was there in the first minute. This is the squad we need, mentally and tactically. And this is what we need today. “We need to be organised when we are defending, we need to be committed with the team. We need the spirit to run, win duels and when we have the ball, it’s about quality and talent. Expressing themselves. I try to give them confidence to do that. We cannot face a game thinking about the position in the table. “In my opinion, we need to do our best, be ourselves because I don’t want a team that plays in a way, then changes a way to play. I want a team with identity, trusts themselves and have confidence in the way we are working to play.” For Forest, an unchanged team from Fenerbahce, while for Liverpool, two changes from Brighton in the FA Cup, Ryan Gravenberch in for Curtis Jones and Hugo Ekitike in for Federico Chiesa. That looks like Szoboszlai at right-back, with Gravenberch as midfield anchor. Nottingham Forest: Ortega, Aina, Milenkovic, Murillo, Williams, Sangare, Anderson, Hutchinson, Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi, Igor Jesus. Subs: Gunn, Morato, Ndoye, Dominguez, Lucca, Yates, Jair Cunha, McAtee, Bakwa. Liverpool: Alisson, Szoboszlai, Konate, van Dijk, Kerkez, Gravenberch, Mac Allister, Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo, Ekitike. Subs: Mamardashvili, Gomez, Chiesa, Jones, Robertson, Nyoni, Ramsay, Morrison, Ngumoha. Referee: Anthony Taylor (Cheshire) Arne Slot was in punchy mood in his Friday press conference. And it went well for Pereira back at Fenerbahce. I was at Vitor Pereira’s unveiling earlier this week. He spoke well, I thought. All change at Forest – again – with Vitor Pereira the third new manager to be shown off to the City Ground this season. His reign started well in midweek with a good Europa League win. Now for Liverpool, on the revival path though rueing defeats to Bournemouth and Manchester City. They’re in a serious race for the top four/five while Forest stare down the relegation battle. Plenty to play for, in a fixture of rich history."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:43Z,Winter Olympics men’s ice hockey final: USA beat Canada in overtime to end 46-year wait for gold – live reaction,"The handshake line is polite but maybe with fewer smiles than a typical Stanley Cup postgame. It’s just so tough for Canada to deal with this. Jack Hughes: “It’s all about our country right now. I love the USA. I love my teammates. The USA Hockey brotherhood is so strong. … “Unbelievable game by Hellebuyck. He was our best player by far.” A touching tribute here to Johnny Gaudreau, a stalwart US player killed in an accident in 2024. They parade a No. 13 jersey with his name on it around the ice. This one is going to be very difficult for Canada to swallow. They could’ve been up 4-1 at the end of regulation. Hellebuyck was one reason why that didn’t happen. A couple of dubious calls didn’t help. But they simply didn’t get it done, despite smothering the USA for nearly all of the second and third periods. The USA held on. And held on some more. And some more. And then Canada didn’t play smart hockey when overtime started, and the USA took advantage. Teamwork bests 1-on-1 ability. USA pass forward and work it to Jack Hughes. It’s over. McDavid again flies solo. Again, nothing doing. (That was QUINN Hughes, btw. There are two.) McDavid tries to win it all himself. Poked away. Hughes gets a chance the other way. Binnington barely gets a glove to it! Here’s what we’re going to do … You know the score. It’s 1-1. The final score will be 2-1. It’s just a question of who scores first. The time is only relevant in the sense that there’s an 18-minute break between each period for resurfacing the ice. Here we go … Tiebreaking procedure: The Olympics no longer have a shootout in a gold medal game. They’ll play 20 minutes of sudden-death (“golden goal” in more positively framed parlance) overtime. Then another. Then another. You don’t have anywhere to be, do you? The US offense hasn’t been generating chances, and Hellebuyck looks like he could deflect blaster shots like a Jedi in Star Wars. Email from Sven Dobbelaere: “Greetings from a European who, well honestly watches one ice hockey game in probably 10 years :) It’s gripping stuff, I’d honestly award the American goalie a gold medal for the saves alone!” He’ll probably be getting some awards no matter the outcome here. Replay shows a Canadian player appealing for a four-minute power play against the USA by pointing to a newly broken tooth. It’s tempting to say this sport was invented by dentists. For the record, NBC’s Mike Tirico also made the comparison between Hellebuyck’s save and Holtby’s. It’s not just the thoughts of a crazed Washington Capitals fan. Replay shows details of a scramble in which the puck was flipped over Hellebuyck, but McAvoy had placed himself in the net to make the unofficial save. Several qualities and people are responsible for keeping the USA in this game long enough to go to overtime … A stunning miss by Nathan MacKinnon. Connor Hellebuyck’s perfectly played angles and one spectacular save, reaching back with his stick to deny Toews. Luck. Bad officiating. Scrappy defense. Luck. Hellebuyck. Since the shot that pinged off the iron near the end of the second period, the US offense has been dormant. It doesn’t matter now. We’ll go to sudden-death OT, with each team having three skaters. Canada keep up the pressure. But they lose control with five seconds left. Are you ready for overtime? Power play over, 48 seconds in regulation … Canada 1-1 USA, 1:03 left, 3rd period: Hellebuyck again comes up big and knocks the puck away. Canada’s power play has generated several shots from five feet away, but they can’t place one past the US goalie. Canada 1-1 USA, 2:10 left, 3rd period: The 4-on-4 is over. Canada on the attack. Canada 1-1 USA, 2:51 left, 3rd period: 4-on-4 for 49 seconds, and if no one scores there, it’ll be a 1:11 Canadian power play. It should be 3:11. Canada 1-1 USA, 3:23 left, 3rd period: It was Jack Hughes with the high stick. Canada played keepaway for vital seconds, killing the power play while the USA couldn’t touch the puck. It’ll be 4-on-4 for 49 seconds. Surely this is a four-minute double major, right? No? This is absurd. A TRIP! We’ll have a delayed penalty. Canada pull the goalie. Canada clear and get a line change. 1:35 left. Cleared. BIG SAVE BINNINGTON. In fairness, straight at his chest. 1:45 Canada take it up the ice short-handed. Not a serious scoring threat, but it kills time. 2:15 left SHOT! SAVE! Rebound, cleared. 2:42 left in the power play. US in the zone but not able to create a chance yet. 3:00 Will update with time checks on the power play. No US action yet, 3:20 left. That’s … fortunate. Bennett was turning around from the boards with his stick up and didn’t notice Hughes. They call it a double minor. Four minutes. Only 6:34 left, and the USA will spend a lot of that on the power play. Delayed penalty coming up for the USA. They maintain possession. Let’s see a replay. The USA shoot from beyond the blue line. That’s their 22nd shot. Canada have 39. Canada 1-1 USA, 7:34 left, 3rd period: So which was the bigger miss – McKinnon hitting the side of the net or the officials not noticing a US player playing the puck as he was leaving, which gave the USA seven players in action. Canada 1-1 USA, 7:40 left, 3rd period: Have the USA weathered the storm? Binnington is under pressure now. But now a terrible miss by the officiating crew! Too many men on the ice. That was blatant. Can officials from other countries count? Maybe give THEM the assignment from now on. Then a scramble in front of the US net! Every Canadian player takes a whack at it. Wayne Gretzky probably came out and shot at some point. Canada 1-1 USA, 9:15 left, 3rd period: Score and time update BEST CHANCE FOR THE USA so far. Binnington sprawls for the stop. WHAT A MISS BY MCKINNON! The Canadian star has the net at his mercy from an acute angle and hits the side of the net. Canada 1-1 USA, 11:00 left, 3rd period: Remember back in the first period, when the USA were quicker to every loose puck? Not any more. Canada 1-1 USA, 12:15 left, 3rd period: The shot count is 36-17. How much longer can Hellebuyck keep it level? Canada 1-1 USA, 13:01 left, 3rd period: Makar ties up one of the Tkachuks. Tom Wilson wins possession to keep the puck in the USA zone. Canada whips in one shot. Then another. The USA are hanging on for dear life here. Canada 1-1 USA, 13:31 left, 3rd period: Giveaway next to the USA goal, but Canada can’t find a good angle to shoot. The USA simply cannot string any passes together. Canada 1-1 USA, 14:49 left, 3rd period: Hellebuyck makes his 34th save of the game and hangs on. This is turning into an instant classic. BREAKAWAY FOR CELEBRINI after a sloppy play by the US attack. But Hellebuyck cuts down the angle, and the shot is untroubling. Canada 1-1 USA, 16:38 left, 3rd period: Canada are dominating. The shot count is 31-17 now. And yet … the longer this goes, the more likely the USA are to sneaking one in. They already hit both posts near the end of the second period. Canada 1-1 USA, 17:56 left, 3rd period: HOW DID THAT NOT GO IN?! Marner shoots. It deflects to Toews, who gets his stick behind Hellebuyck in the crease and shoots into what is briefly an empty net. Too briefly. Hellebuyck stretches back and gets his stick on it. Shades of Braden Holtby in the 2018 playoffs. Canada 1-1 USA, 19:05 left, 3rd period: We start this period the way much of the second period proceeded – with icing calls against the USA. Start third period … Twenty minutes to gold. Or more. About hockey fighting … One of the most analyzed aspect of sports is the hockey “code,” unwritten rules that tell players when and how they can drop the gloves and engage. In one sense, it’s charming. NHL rules harshly (and reasonably) punish anyone who tries to turn a 1-on-1 fight into a 2-on-1. No matter how mad one team may be at the other, there are lines not to be crossed. Many enforcers won’t pick fights with injured players. Dueling with someone significantly smaller is frowned upon. And there are countless stories of enforcers talking about who’s buying the beer and the pizza after the game. And sometimes, fights serve no apparent purpose, as seen in this classic video of someone taking on legendary puncher Georges Laraque, with one of the funniest buildups ever caught on audio. Fighters are often trying to just swing the momentum in a game. But the most vociferous defenders of the practice insist that it’s also a necessary self-policing safety valve. If players couldn’t drop the gloves to keep each other honest, they insist, players would instead resort to dirty play. And yet the most meaningful games in the sport – Olympics, most Stanley Cup playoff games – proceed without punching. Also, few people ever dissect the actions that led to a fight. A tough hit on a star player? Forgetting to tip the bar staff the night before? No one ever knows. And The Code suggests that players should leave such matters on the ice. What a shock THAT would’ve been! Killing a 5-on-3 power play is normally a massive momentum boost for the penalty-killing team. But the USA’s advantage was brief. Canada piled on the pressure – pass after pass, shot after shot – while the US defensemen chased ghosts. Canada’s lead in the shot count is now 27-16. And yet this game is still tied only by a couple of millimeters after that last US shot. The USA get a chance that goes double-doink off two posts! Canada quite relieved there. We’ll end the period with some argy-bargy near the US bench. Canada 1-1 USA, 1:00 left, 2nd period: We’re hearing “ole, ole, ole, ole” in the stands. Nice change of pace. Canada 1-1 USA, 1:33 left, 2nd period: Toews got the assist on that goal, so the two defensemen who were to blame for the USA goal have combined to even it up. They’ve had stellar games since then. It’s no more than Canada deserve. They win the faceoff, flip it back to Makar, and he sends a laser through Hellebuyck’s arm and leg pads. Canada 0-1 USA, 1:50 left, 2nd period: Icing on the USA. Rinse, repeat. Is anything more stupidly entertaining than hockey fights? Canada 0-1 USA, 2:30 left, 2nd period: Icing on the USA. Canada definitely in the ascendancy, now outshooting the USA 24-15. The broadcasters focus on the stadium organist. As one should. The Capitals have fallen apart since parting ways with their organist. Canada 0-1 USA, 3:08 left, 2nd period: A US player loses a stick. Canada try to capitalize. Makar shoots from relatively close range, Hellebuyck smothers, and we have shoves that turn into half-hearted punches for some reason. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:35 left, 2nd period: Is this the inverse of the women’s final, where Canada got a goal and held on for much of the game? Another good shot for Canada – now 22-15, and Hellebuyck is making a case for MVP honors in this final. Canada 0-1 USA, 5:13 left, 2nd period: Now Canada create some chances, and Toews just misses as he rushes toward the post. McDavid, who has to be in the conversation if you’re talking about the best player in the world at the moment, also had a chance in that sequence. Canada 0-1 USA, 6:05 left, 2nd period: Canada’s turn to be pinned back. They finally clear, but the USA bring it right back in. You can sense the momentum firmly behind the team that just killed a 5-on-3. Canada 0-1 USA, 7:27 left, 2nd period: Tom Wilson chases after the puck to try to prevent an icing call, and he’s held off by the retreating US defense. Then he takes a skate to the head. Helmets are good. Canada 0-1 USA, 7:57 left, 2nd period: Canadian shot deflected high. We’re back at full strength on each side. That’s a glaring missed opportunity. Teams don’t often get 90 seconds of 5-on-3. Canada 0-1 USA, 8:09 left, 2nd period: Canada win the faceoff. They have a player open at the doorstep, but they can’t connect. 5-on-3 over. Chants of USA. Then Canada commits an elementary error, getting called for icing on their own power play, which is almost over. Celebrini with a shot that never had a chance. Now a better one, but Hellebuyck is equal to it. Only 8 seconds left in the 5-on-3. McKinnon whips a shot wide, and the USA clear. They’re able to change. Then they stop Canada from getting in to the zone. Going for quick commentary during the 5-on-3. USA win a faceoff and clear. Canada 0-1 USA, 10:05 left, 2nd period: Canada 43.75% on the power play in this tournament. USA 100% penalty killing. But now it’s going to be 5-on-3!! For a full 1:33. McAvoy with an ill-timed grab. This is pivotal. If Canada can’t score here, the USA will be in their heads. Canada 0-1 USA, 10:33 left, 2nd period: Sustained possession for the USA now … But it’s a breakaway to McDavid! He’s in alone on Hellebuyck, but he’s stopped. He may have wanted a penalty on that one. Replay shows it was pretty close to penalty-shot territory. NOW it’s a penalty on the next sequence, and Canada will have their first power play. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:10 left, 2nd period: Replay from the big US shot a couple of minutes ago – Brock Nelson was the beneficiary of the Toews giveaway, and he may rue his placement on that opportunity. Oh, surely that’s a penalty! No? How about the other end? No? OK, cool. The referees are getting a wonderful view of the game, at least. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:46 left, 2nd period: Canada’s passes are crisp, and Hellebuyck once again has to be at his sharpest. Canada now up 13-10 in shots. The USA haven’t had any possession in the offensive zone in several minutes. But now the puck is loose, and Binnington has to smother. Canada 0-1 USA, 13:54 left, 2nd period: It’s all Canada – until Toews gives it away! Huge stop by Binnington. Canada 0-1 USA, 15:04 left, 2nd period: Hellebuyck is under intense pressure now. Long-range shots, short-range shots. His defense is scrambling to cope with the Canadian attack. Marchand with a big shot forces a good save. Canada 0-1 USA, 16:24 left, 2nd period: Makar with some incisive passes, but his Canadian teammates can’t quite finish. Canada 0-1 USA, 18:17 left, 2nd period: McDavid with a chance! It hits Hellebuyck and then trickles wide of the post. Then a half-decent chance at the other end. Canada 0-1 USA, 19:08 left, 2nd period: Why do players grow playoff beards but not Olympic beards? Just wondering. Canada 0-1 USA, 19:34 left, 2nd period: We had some line shuffling for Canada. It’ll take me some time to sort it out, so just … trust me. The lines have changed. First shot of the period to the USA, and they now lead 9-8 in shots. Second-period faceoff … Canada needs to dig out of a hole … A quick peek at what this sport means in Canada, on Bluesky. Bluesky also has a call to add a Spring and a Fall Olympics. I’m in. It’s going to be a long 28 months or so until the next Olympics. We’ve been spoiled by having four in less than five years post-pandemic. Day 4: I’m getting really sick of the music they play on the broadcast feeds during breaks in the action. Day 17: I’m going to miss this music. Guardian correspondents are sharing some of their favorite moments of the Games on our multisport blog: Nervy moments after a bad giveaway in the Canadian zone. The USA have nearly evened out the shot count. It’s 8-7 Canada. Should be some soul-searching in the Canadian locker room. Too many defensive errors. Too slow and deliberate in the attack. Too willing to settle for shots from the blue line. US defensemen have made their share of errors as well, but they’re generally winning the battles in their own end when it counts. Canada 0-1 USA, 0:48 left, 1st period: Canada kill the power play, then get called for icing. Credit to Toews for atoning for his earlier mistake with a strong defensive play in front of his net. Canada 0-1 USA, 1:33 left, 1st period: Theodore is the unlucky Canadian whistled for hooking, though it’s far less than what Eichel did in exactly the same spot. Again, I’ll ask why this game is being officiated by a USA/Canada crew. Is this figure skating? Canada 0-1 USA, 2:57 left, 1st period: It’ll be a USA power play. That’s a weaaaaak call. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:00 left, 1st period: Acute-angled shot, and Binnington has to smother it. For the most part, the USA have opted for quality over quantity on their shots, but that’s a good change of pace to make the Canadian goalie think. Canada 0-1 USA, 4:49 left, 1st period: Canada lay the puck back to Sanheim, and he rips it on frame. Hellebuyck snags it. The USA probably won’t mind if the defensemen have to take all of Canada’s shots. I’m reminded that for some reason I find the US players’ habit of gnawing on their mouthguards during breaks in the action really off-putting. Maybe it’s because I need to get a cavity filled this week. Canada 0-1 USA, 5:00 left, 1st period: Binnington has to make an awkward save as Canada’s defense again can’t cope with some pressure. Canada just seems tighter. The USA are playing with gleeful abandon, and they’re winning every loose puck in their own zone. Canada 0-1 USA, 6:50 left, 1st period: USA’s Eichel very lucky not get a hooking call. Canada have outshot the USA 7-2. But the USA have had the better chances, even aside from the goal. Matthew Tkachuk sends one skittering across the front of the goal. Canada 0-1 USA, 8:38 left, 1st period: Makar threads a shot from the blue line with some pace, but Hellebuyck hangs on. Good Canadian pressure here. Canada 0-1 USA, 9:55 left, 1st period: Marchand, another villain to all opposing fans in the NHL but probably temporarily forgiven by Canadian fans for now, clumsily surrenders the puck twice. Celebrini, though, rips a shot that pops off Hellebuyck’s leg pad. Officiating note: The referees are Gord Dwyer and Chris Rooney. They’re from the USA and Canada. File that under “things that wouldn’t happen in most sports.” Surely some European referees would be up to the challenge. Canada 0-1 USA, 11:29 left, 1st period: The bulk of the crowd responds with “CAN-A-DA!” We need more creative cheers in the Olympics. Now Binnington comes up big on a deflected shot. Nearly a second for Boldy. Canada 0-1 USA, 12:00 left, 1st period: Watching the replay – how Toews managed to go through that play without interposing himself between Boldy and the puck is beyond me. Binnington just seemed shocked. And now the “U-S-A” chants start. Atrocious defense from Makar and Toews, as Boldy skates between them and flips the puck over their sticks, then beats Binnington one-on-one. A shocking lapse after a bright start. Credit to Boldy for the clever stickwork, though. Canada 0-0 USA, 14:00 left, 1st period: Despite that opening 80 seconds of pinning the Canadians back in their own zone, the USA haven’t managed a shot on goal. That just changed … Canada 0-0 USA, 14:36 left, 1st period: Tom Wilson of the 2018 Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals sends a shot just wide, then follows up with a trademark hit on the USA’s Dylan Larkin. (Yes, you can guess where I live.) Canada 0-0 USA, 15:49 left, 1st period: Suzuki drops it back to Stone for another Canadian shot. Pet peeve: When players congregate around a loose puck, that is not a “scrum.” Call it a ruck if you like. Or a maul. Canada 0-0 USA, 16:40 left, 1st period: Good rush for McKinnon’s line for Canada. Another tic-tac-toe combination, and Hellebuyck has to hang on. Canada 0-0 USA, 17:59 left, 1st period: Canada get the first official shot of the game, easily held by Hellebuyck. Canada reclaim the puck and force a scramble in front of the net. Each team gets a few good shoves at each other. This is not the NHL, so players do not want to get in a fight. Canada 0-0 USA, 18:40 left, 1st period: Good hit from McDavid, but the USA maintain possession and send a shot whistling past the net. Canada simply can’t get out of their own zone for more than a minute. Away we go … What else has happened at the Games today? And what were some of the highlights of the past two weeks and change? Check our multisport coverage: Stadium countdown at 7 minutes. Plenty more time for more “Miracle”-themed programming. This is, coincidentally, the 46th anniversary of the Miracle on Ice, and the US men have not won it since. In that time, they’ve reached the final twice, both times in North America, and lost both of them. The US men have never won gold outside their home country. The famous win was, of course, in 1980. They also won in 1960. NBC, meanwhile, has brought out 1980 men’s hockey legend Mike Eruzione to talk about what it means to play for the USA. He says this is the best US team ever assembled. He also notes “there’s not a TV set in Canada that isn’t tuned to this game,” and that’s probably not an outlandish statement. The United States will be facing a hostile crowd at the Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena as they seek their third ever Olympic title in men’s hockey and first since the Miracle on Ice team of 1980. The Americans were greeted with a chorus of lusty boos when they took the ice in their white jerseys for their 20-minute warm-up ahead of today’s gold medal game. It already felt like there were more Canada shirts in the building and along the concourses of the brand-new 14,700-seat arena on Milan’s south-eastern edge. Now it sounds that way too. It is arguably the hottest ticket of the Milano Cortina Olympics and that’s clear from the scenes outside the gates, where hordes of Canadian and American fans in hockey sweaters are pounding beers and roaring through songs and chants in glorious 53F (12C) sunshine. And now it’s the saddest moment of every four years … Olympic curling is over. Anna Hasselborg goes back-to-back, and my fantasy team dominated. What was your favorite moment of the Olympics? Alysa Liu’s gold medal performance? Megan Oldham soaring to two medals? Snoop Dogg showing up at curling? Send in your favorites, and I’ll run through them during intermissions. So many USA-Canada showdowns in Italy this year. Women’s hockey gold to the USA. Women’s curling bronze to Canada. Fitting that the Olympics will draw to a close with the two North American rivals facing off in the last event, the men’s hockey final. As in 1980, the hockey tournament has political undertones, but things are quite a bit different when each team has a gaggle of NHL players, not a Soviet Union team shrouded in mystery when it’s not dominating on the ice. And this time around, don’t expect any underdog-rallying speeches in the US locker room that will be commemorated on film. Personal story: When Sidney Crosby scored the overtime winner for Canada on home ice in 2010, I was at high altitude browsing a gift shop in Whistler, where I had just ridden the breathtaking Peak-to-Peak gondola. I made sure the other patrons didn’t know I was from that other country. Crosby will be missed in this final. But this is still the star-studded final hockey fans wanted to see. Enjoy. A big early blow for the Canadians. Their captain, Sidney Crosby, has been ruled out of today’s game. The 38-year-old has won two Olympics golds and three Stanley Cups, but did not play in his team’s semi-final win over Finland due to a knee injury. Canada coach Jan Cooper said on Saturday he would wait until the last minute before making a decision on Crosby’s participation. “We will see. I watched him skate today and we will meet tonight,” said Cooper. “He won’t put himself in harm’s way, and he will not put the team in harm’s way.” Beau will be here shortly. In the meantime, here’s what the players said ahead of today’s game: The US and Canada are prepared for a stormy men’s ice hockey final on Sunday as the long-time rivals face off for Winter Olympic gold. This year’s Olympics mark the first time NHL players have competed at the Winter Games since 2014, meaning many of the best players in the world will face each other on Sunday. While Canada are the betting favourites – and have won the most ice hockey golds in Olympic history – the US players say they have motivation to upset their northern neighbours. “There’s hatred there,” USA’s Brady Tkachuk told ESPN on Saturday. “I mean, they’ve been the top dog. They’ve been the best for the last bunch of years, and for us, we want to be in that position, be the best. So it’s going to be a game where I think a lot of guys could say, this is the biggest game that they’ve ever played in.” The rivalry between the teams has sharpened recently, particularly as political tensions have risen between Canada and the United States. At last year’s 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, Canadian fans booed the US anthem and there were a number of on-ice fights. Canada’s Connor McDavid acknowledged there is extra spice when his team play the US. “It is the game everybody wanted and hoped for, and it will be a great game,” he said. “It now comes down to one game between two teams. It is a hockey game, and we are excited about that. Team Canada playing Team USA in a hockey game – that is what it is. You can read the full story here:"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:03:25Z,"Baftas 2026: the red carpet, the ceremony, the winners – follow live! ","On the red carpet, Glenn Close is telling Dazed magazine that the line “I’m not going to be ignored, Dan” from her role in Fatal Attraction is still stuck in her head. Close, who is presenting an award later, definitely isn’t being overlooked in this beautiful black coat with shimmering silver embroidery detailing. The 78-year-old has hot-footed it from the Erdem show at London fashion week, where she sat front row next to Helen Mirren. We haven’t seen Stormzy on a red carpet in a little while. His last big appearance was at the 2025 Met Gala, where he wore an unbuttoned white dress shirt over a vest from Haider Ackermann’s debut collection for Tom Ford. Today, the rapper has gone for a traditional tuxedo and accessorised it with a little red rose brooch in place of a corsage. The look is smart, chic and shows why a tux is an all-time classic. Kerry Washington, who is presenting an award later, has chosen a trailing gown from Prada for the occasion. The navy dress features some gorgeous floral applique detailing around the bustier. We wouldn’t like to be tackling any steps with a train that long, especially in front of an audience but, then again, we are not Hollywood stars. A little light reading For anyone who fancies some homework before we know the final results, here’s a primer: The full list of nominations Peter Bradshaw’s predictions News on who’s nominated and who isn’t, plus more on the snubs The identity crisis facing the Baftas Why awards-show hosting is the worst job in the world, plus more on this year’s host, Alan Cumming The best Bafta moments in history – ranked (features a fantastic photo of John Hurt) All the best Hollywood stylists will tell you the trick to nailing red carpet style is to wear something you are comfortable in. Paddington Bear has taken this advice and ran with it. The bear from Peru has stuck to his signature blue wool duffel coat and red felt hat. We’ve recently seen duffel coats on the catwalks of designers including Coach and Simone Rocha, and the Oasis star Liam Gallagher, so Paddington is very on trend. He hasn’t overlooked the glam, either. Those claws look particularly shiny – perhaps the result of pre-carpet pawdicure? Hello everyone, Chloe from the fashion desk here. For the next two hours I’ll be overseeing the good, the great and the downright bizarre looks on the red carpet. The first to arrive is this year’s host Alan Cumming. The presenter and host of The Traitors US is known for his love of a flamboyant look and he is not disappointing here. No doubt, Cummingwill change for his actual presenter duties, but for his arrival he has gone for a gradient coloured coat covered in tassels. Swishing along the red carpet, Cumming demands attention. Stand by for a closer look at his hair. Here is Chase Infiniti, who is nominated for best leading actress for her role in One Battle After Another. The American has gone for strapless burgundy fluted gown which, thanks to a carpet’s similar colouring, gives the illusion that she is hovering above ground. To Infiniti and beyond! As I said Cumming, loves a flamboyant look and nothing says theatrical like swirls of neon feathers glued to one’s scalp. It’s just the fun start we needed. Hello everyone, and welcome to the Guardian’s liveblog of the 2026 Bafta film awards. This is exactly the place to be if you enjoy celebrating the best cinema of the last year. It is also the place to be if you like looking at pictures of famous people being visibly surprised by dour weather, but that’s probably less important. As always, the Baftas need a little bit of explaining, so here we go. As we speak, the red carpet is already in full swing at London’s Royal Festival Hall. Two hours from now the ceremony will begin, where it will run for between two-and-a-half to three hours. However, that will mean nothing to television viewers, because the BBC’s broadcast of the ceremony doesn’t begin until 7pm. Clear? So here’s how the next few hours will go. Any moment now, Chloe MacDonnell will start bringing you the best looks from the red carpet. Then, the show will start, and we’ll all pretend that we don’t know who the winners are. And then, at 7pm, I’ll cover the glorious two-hour BBC broadcast. After that, we’ll just keep dancing until we’re all exhausted. Now that the housekeeping is over, we have a lot to look forward to tonight. More than most years, the Baftas are shaping up to be a pretty decent bellwether for the Oscars. One Battle After Another leads the way with 14 nominations, while Sinners follows with 13 and both Hamnet and Marty Supreme close behind on 11 each. It might also be the night that The Ballad of Wallis Island finally gets the awards it deserves, which would be very exciting. But this is all to come. For now, kick back and enjoy yourself. It’s going to be a long night."

Tullis-Joyce almost gives the ball straight to James under pressure. 19 min: The game is settling into a rhythm.

The American winger wins a corner for the home side. Manchester United get us under way, kicking from right to left. Meanwhile, Sonia Bompastor spoke about Manchester United’s unbeaten run. We know we are facing a really good team. They are in really good form and there have been a lot of wins in the games for them recently. So we are prepared for that and, as usual, the training this week has been good. Manchester United manager Marc Skinner spoke about the timing of the fixture in his prematch press conference. On Sunday we’re playing one of the best teams in English history, and it’s an early-round draw – but that’s football. That’s the beauty of the cup. There’s an element of luck in competitions. Drawing Chelsea might feel like rough luck, but that’s part of it. It’s what makes the cup special. In most year’s today’s game would be a cup final. At least one of the two teams has made it to the FA Cup Final in the last five years, including the 2022-23 and 2024-25 seasons when they faced each other. Yesterday’s only FA Cup fixture saw second-tier Birmingham City thrash fourth-tier Chatham Town 8-0. You can read Tom Garry’s match report here.

Today’s game is a repeat of last season’s final in which Chelsea won 3-0 to complete a domestic treble. While Chelsea are still fighting on four fronts, the prospect of Sonia Bompastor’s side winning another treble is no longer on the cards after back to back defeats against Arsenal and Manchester City in the league. But they bounced back with wins against Spurs and Liverpool to put them within a point of Manchester United in the WSL. Meanwhile, Manchester United are buoyant. They haven’t lost a game since November and Marc Skinner registered his 100th win with the club when they beat Atletico Madrid 2-0 to complete a 5-0 aggregate victory over them in the Champions League on Wednesday. Today’s game will be preparation for when both clubs meet again next month in the League Cup Final. Kick off is at 1:30pm. Join me for updates."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:02:00Z,France v Italy: Six Nations rugby union – live,"“Italy must be more accurate,” says their former skipper Segio Parisse on ITV. Dan Biggar says it’s “been a funny kind of game,” pointing out that Italy have maybe been the better team. White we munch on our halftime orange, George G wants to remind us of the history between these nations: You mentioned the Garibaldi Cup. Worth noting Garibaldi was born in Nice when it was still part of the Italian kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia. So if he was a rugby player I think he’d qualify for both France &amp; Italy. Nice was handed to France in exchange for French military help in Italian unification so Garibaldi later lamented he’d become a foreigner in his own home town. Interesting stuff. Wonder what position he’d play? France almost score with a superb strike move! Dupont missed Ramos off the scrum but the 10 was on the loop and had it off his centre before a delayed pass found Drean on a blind run. The winger darted for the right corner but was shunted out about two metres short. That bring an energetic half of rugby to a close. Italy can maybe feel slightly hard down by as the score doesn’t quite reflect the flow of the game. But France are so clinical. Back in a bit. 40 min: Italy spill the restart. How frustrating. That hands France a chance to strike on the visitor’s 22 just before the break. A swinging left boot and Italy chip away at the deficit. 39 min: Italy win the scrum penalty! They’ve already handed out lessons to Scotland and Ireland. Now the Italian pack is getting the better of the monstrous French heavies. It’s well within range and Garbisi calls for the tee. 38 min: Italy enjoying a spell on the ball between halfway and France’s 22. But they’re not really going anywhere. France’s defence has them comfortably at arm’s length and, in an attempt to up the ante, Garbisi throws a forward pass. France make a change in the front row ahead of this scrum. Cros makes way for Neti. Another Tolouse man in a team stacked with them. 36 min: Jegou flings a wild pass that is gobbled up by Italy on halfway. Too eager and they get away with it. Menoncello chases the kick but LBB is there to watch ti bobble over the try line and dots down safely. 35 min: France show unreal continuity in close quarters. Dupont found Meafou with a delicious off-load. Eight phases from a scrum on the 22 and they’re a couple of metres short. Gailleton took his eyes off the ball in midfield and Italy manage to push France back to the 22 and come up with the steal! They set themselves up for an exit and Fusco hoofs a kick that is partially charged down. France come again from halfway. France shoot themselves in the foot! Credit must go to Italy. They launched a counter down the right with Menoncello who kicked upfield and had the ball stop jus short of the French line. Ramos ran back and flicked it up for Attissogbe who didn’t kick but tried to run it back from his own line. He was swarmed by three Italian cleaners and when the ball bobbled lose the Italian fullback was there to dot down. The conversion from the right of the poles is missed. What a game we have here! A bolt from le bleu! From nothing. Italy had the line-out but overcooked it, missing their jumpers. France hacked ahead as the ball bounced and it fell into the breadbasket of Gailleton who exploded upfield and away from the chasing Italians. When he ran out of room down the left tram he found Ramos back infield. The 10 pinned his ears down and went for the corner before finishing under contact. Sublime. Three red zone visits. Three tries. Ramos dusts himself off and nails the tricky conversion from the left. 28 min: Italy win the line-out just beyond France’s 22 and maul it into the red zone. It stalls and Fusco is told to use it. Menoncello hits a lovely line and makes about 10 metres before he’s dragged down. But the ball is pinched! By Dupont! Is there anything he can’t do? So strong to snatch it out of Menconcello’s hands as the Italian centre was held up in the air. 26 min: Italy have it on France’s 22. They’re building. Eight phases. Menoncello on the right. 10 phases. Garbisi hoists a high cross-field into France’s 22 and Drean does really well under pressure to hold on and take the mark. 23 min: Italy close again! Superb down the left wing with Marin bursting through contact and he kept going. Capuozzo was in support. He then found Lynagh who didn’t off-load to the support on his left. The cleaners lost their feet and gave away a penalty five short of the French line. Brilliant but not brilliant enough. Shortly after France gave away an accidental off-side from their line-out. Think they used to call those a truck and trailer. 21 min: Italy understandably wanted to put pressure on that French scrum but were pinned for going straight on the angle. Ferrari penalised. Ramos missed touch though so Italy can build on halfway. 20 min: Italy come so close from that line-out. It goes swiftly off the top and two lovely delayed passes from Garbisi for blind runners round the corner – first Lynagh off his wing and then centre Marin – has the ball go coast to coast and short about a metre or two from the left corner. They then keep it with the forwards but two carries later the ball is spilled and Meafou hacks a clearance. They’ll come back for a French scrum on their own line. 19 min: Italy win a penalty inside France’s half but turn down the option of taking the three points. Garbisi punts it out to set up a line-out on their right about 20 metres from the try line. 18 min: Italy just about come away with the ball from their line-out, but they can’t punch through midfield. France are bossing the point of contact. Fusco has no choice but to hoist a box. He finds touch over halfway. 17 min: Attissogbe proves he can play at 15 as he comes within a metre of landing a 50-22. Still, that’s a great kick. Pressure on Italy back in their own patch. So clinical! Off the line-out they went down the line. Ramos had a dart himself, coming to within a metre. Both centres Gailleton and Brau-Boirie did likewise. Dupont chucked an overhead pass to Drean on the right wing before moving back infield. Then, with the Italians scrambling, Dupont hit a short pass for Meafou on a good line and nhe barged over from close range. Ramos doesn’t add the extras from right of the sticks. 13 min: Ramos now nails a 50-22! Poor from Italy. Off first phases Garbisi lifts a nothing kick that Flament grabs and flings to Dupont. He then finds his 10 who lands a wonder kick that dribbles out for a French throw inside Italy’s red zone. 12 min: Ramos overcooks a kick from first receiver off the scrum and its out on the full. Italy will get the line-out in French territory on the 10m line. 11 min: This time Nicotera finds his jumper legally but the ball is lost is contact shortly after. Will be another scrum to France, between their 22 and halfway. 10 min: That was a steal from Menoncello who pinched the ball and stifled the French move. Dupont, on his 22, hoofs it out around halfway. Italy are holding their own. 9 min: Solid scrum from France after a little delay. Attissogbe joins the line but loses it in contact. Goes backwards though so France, through Gaileton, continue. Theres a steal, Zuliani has it and kicks ahead. Italy counter. Attissogbe cleans up on his own 22 and France survive a scare. 7 min: Disappointing from Nicoetera. His first throw is skew and since France contested it’ll be a change of possession. Scrum to France. They could have gone for the line-out. Curious how this goes. 6 min: LBB has it on the left wing and chips and chases and almost gets it. Ramos dictating play. Solid from France. They get the line-out as Italy went back to cover LBB’s kick. France win the ball and set about another attack in the middle of the park. OH! But Italy win a penalty on the floor. Great breakdown work from L Cannone who got over the ball in a flash. Eight matches in a row for LBB! That’s a Six Nations record and my goodness, he is simply unreal! So quick. It was from broken play, Dupont got hold of a loose ball and swifly hoofed ahead. LBB exploded onto the ball, blitzing the covering defence and dotted down. Ramos slots the extras. I think it’s fair to call the French winger a cheat code. 3 min: Italy put a high kick on Attisogbe who doesn;t hold on but the bounce is kind and France keep possesion. Until it’s ripped away and the Italians attack down the left. A big hit from Drean stops momentum. Italy forced back to their 22 and they run it. Capuozzo dances. Energetic start from both teams. 1 min: Capuozzo wins the ball and Italy turn possession. They kick long and France have it back. Dupont, from his 22, kicks as well. Both teams feeling each other out early. Strange to see Italy in red. Italian rugby federation (FIR) explained: “The jersey is entirely in ‘ Garibaldi Red ‘, a color reminiscent of the jackets worn by Garibaldi’s soldiers and which has become synonymous with values such as heroism and indomitable spirit, which the Italian athletes perfectly embody on the pitch.” A reminder that both teams compete for the Giuseppe Garibaldi Trophy, name after the revolutionary who helped forge the unified nation of Italy. Righto, Garbisi in red kicks off and away we go! Anthems time. Is this the best combination of national anthems in our sport? The players are getting ready to leave the tunnel as we switch over to the commentary on ITV. This might not be in Paris, but it still looks like the centre of the world. If I’ve said it once I’ve said it a thousand times, no other nation, even South Africa or New Zealand, put on a show at the rugby like the French do. They just make it feel so epic! Bad news for the mercurial 10. Although it’s hardly a downgrade as Ramos, who has found himself at first receiver this campaign, slots in at 10. The wonderful Attissogbe shifts fullback (very keen to see how he gets on there) and Dréan comes on at 14. Did I mention French rugby has deep pockets? In the last five games between these teams, the team that has scored the first try has won just once. Slightly warped as France have won four of those, with that aforementioned draw, but it shows that registering the first try doesn’t guarantee success. Oh, and there are some World Rugby ranking points on offer. France sits third on the charts, while Italy are in 10th. Not that it counts for much, but after 51 Tests, France have a 47-3 record against the Italians with just one draw between them. That came two years ago when Paolo Garbisi hit the post with the last kick of the match as the teams shared the spoils after a 13-13 stalemate. I covered the MBM in that game. Was a belter. Fingers crossed we get another one. This might be the first real test of France’s scrum The Italians dominated both the Scottish and Irish packs and are a formidable force in the set piece. Danilo Fischetti is one of the form props in the game. But he’s not just a battering ram. He’s pretty handy in the loose too and has made 15 carries this year for more post-contact metres (28) than any other prop. Some reading on yesterday’s action while we gear up for this one: If the Opta supercomputer is to be believed, this is as good as over before its started. The machine that works in mysterious ways informs me that France have a 92.2% chance of winning with a predicted score of 41-18. Sounds about right to me. I’ve had a shocker. As reader Gavin Daly points out, “‘The game is being played in Lille!” My apologies. That’s corrected. I hope no travelling fan made the same me! The lightning feet of Ange Capuozzo returns after a spell out with injury while Italy starts with the same pack that featured in Dublin last Saturday, with Michele Lamaro captaining the side from blind-side flanker. Capuozzo slots in at fullback, replacing Lorenzo Pani who misses out on the match-day 23 entirely. That’s the only change to the starting XV from last week. A bunch of regulars are still missing, including Ignacio Brex who remains unavailable for family reasons. Italy: 15 Ange Capuozzo, 14 Louis Lynagh, 13 Tommaso Menoncello, 12 Leonardo Marin, 11 Monty Ioane, 10 Paolo Garbisi, 9 Alessandro Fusco, 1 Danilo Fischetti, 2 Giacomo Nicotera, 3 Simone Ferrari, 4 Niccolo Cannone, 5 Andrea Zambonin, 6 Michele Lamaro, 7 Manuel Zuliani, 8 Lorenzo Cannone. Replacements: 16 Pablo Dimcheff, 17 Mirco Spagnolo, 18 Giosue Zilocchi, 19 Federico Ruzza, 20 Riccardo Favretto, 21 David Odiase, 22 Alessandro Garbisi, 23 Paolo Odogwu. Fabian Galthie has named an entirely new second row and not dropped an ounce of quality. Those are some deep pockets the French coach has and he’s reached down and plucked out Thibaud Flament and Emmanuel Meafou to replace Charles Ollivon and Mickael Guillard, both of whom drop to the bench. More heft, less jazz then. It’s the same backline that has done the business so far as Antoine Dupont and Matthieu Jalibert continue to forge the most exciting halfback combo in the game. On the bench, Peato Mauvaka, Georges-Henri Colombe and Pierre-Louis Barassi come in for Maxime Lamothe, Regis Montagne and Noah Nene. France: 15 Thomas Ramos, 14 Theo Attissogbe, 13 Emilien Gailleton, 12 Fabien Brau-Boirie, 11 Louis Bielle-Biarrey, 10 Matthieu Jalibert, 9 Antoine Dupont, 1 Jean-Baptiste Gros, 2 Julien Marchand, 3 Dorian Aldegheri, 4 Thibaud Flament, 5 Emmanuel Meafou, 6 Francois Cros, 7 Oscar Jegou, 8 Anthony Jelonch. Replacements: 16 Peato Mauvaka, 17 Rodrigue Neti, 18 Georges-Henri Colombe, 19 Charles Ollivon, 20 Mickael Guillard, 21 Lenni Nouchi, 22 Baptiste Serin, 23 Pierre-Louis Barassi. It’s already been a weekend of shocks. Not necessarily in terms of results. After all, Ireland are a side still capable of mixing it with the big boys of world rugby and you’d expect Scotland to have the measure of a struggling Welsh outfit. But did anyone see the shellacking handed out to England on their own patch? And what about the Welsh? Did anyone really predict that they’d be leading right til the 75th minute? If we can take anything from Saturday’s action its that we can’t take anything for granted. France should romp to victory. They are, for my money, comfortably the second best team in the world and overwhelming favourites to secure a grand slam. But Italy are no mugs. They’re well coached, tenacious on defence, adventurous on attack and have more than a handful of genuine superstars. Don’t be too surprised if the visitors in red provide one more shock before we close out the weekend. Kick-off at 3:10pm in Lille (4:10pm local time). Teams and updates to come."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:01:24Z,Tottenham v Arsenal: Premier League – live,"As for Arsenal, following the collapse at Wolves, Arteta makes one change, bringing in Leandro Trossard for Noni Madueke. That means Bukayo Saka’s sojourn in the middle, behind the striker, is over for now – a shame, in mine, as they need him involved in the play as often as possible, and have decent options out wide. Now that you ask, I’d have gone with Eze left and Madueke right – Arsenal need to let opponents, especially such poor ones, worry about them. But as we discussed earlier, change is right there for us, but isn’t easy to effect. So that’s two attackers, Kolo Muani and Simons, with 58 games for Spurs this season between them … and five goals. The Tottenham WayTM or what? Sky reckon Spurs are going 4-1-2-3, with Sarr on the wing; that sounds odd, but then so does Palhinha at centre-back. Otherwise, Dominic Solanke, who had some kind of throat situation, is left out in favour of Randal Kolo Muani, who Tudor had at Juve, and who’s managed three goals in 27 appearances so far this season, all of them in Europe. Back to Tudor’s first Tottenham team, loads of players are missing, injured – Destiny Udogie, Kevin Danso, Lucas Bergvall, Ben Davies, Rodrigo Bentancur, Mohammed Kudus, James Maddison, Dejan Kulusevski and Pedro Porro – in that context, Thomas Frank can consider himself extremely unlucky. Even with everyone available, it’s a poor side, but without all those mentioned, how is he supposed to do anything? And yet it’s also fair to say that his way of playing did not look like one that could be upscaled for a team wanting to dominate, and when you lose the crowd as he did, justifiably so, there’s no coming back. I’ve not a clue who Spurs go to next, though: where on earth do you find a manager players will join for, who plays attractive football that enabled them to compete against better funded, more enticing rivals? Mauricio Pochettino is the only person to do it post-David Pleat in 1986-87, so perhaps they’ll get him after the World Cup, but does he have the same in him again, the English game having progressed without him and Harry Kane now in Munich? We’ve so much other sport for you it’s an absolute joke: I’ll level with you: it’s taken me the last 15 minutes to try and work out what on earth Igor Tudor is doing. I’m guessing it’s Palhinha in the middle of a back three, because managers trying to force a 3-4-2-1 on players unsuited to it has such a strong recent history of Premier-League success. I can’t say I’m entirely sure how you can win a football match with two attackers on the pitch but, on the plus side, he and his XI will have to go some to deliver a performance as pointless and as cowardly as Thomas Frank’s lot did when these sides convened at Arsenal earlier in the season. I’m not sure I’ve seen a side asked to do less to record a 4-1 derby win. Tottenham Hotspur (a possible 3-4-2-1 that could ba anything): Vicario; Dragusin, Palhinha, Van de Ven; Gray, Bissouma, Sarr, Spence; Gallagher, Xavi; Kolo Muani. Subs: Austin, Richarlison, Tel, Solanke, Souza, Olusesi, Williams-Barnett, Rowswell, Wilson. Arsenal (4-3-3): Raya; Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Hincapie; Zubimendi, Rice, Eze; Saka, Gyokeres, Trossard. Subs: Arrizabalaga, Mosquera, Calafiori, Lewis-Skelly, Norgaard, Madueke, Martinelli, Odegaard, Jesus. Referee: Peter Bankes (Lancashire) There’s a therapeutic idea that we create ourselves afresh every day, in full control of the person we are – or, to answer the Stone Roses’ question, we’re not etched in stone but sketched in the sand. It’s a liberating, comforting, affirming – and daunting – reality. A liberating, comforting, affirming, daunting reality and not one easily inhabited, because changing ourselves is difficult – consider Mikel Arteta, to pick a name at random. His excellent work – albeit with serious boardroom backing – turned Arsenal from a rabble into title challengers but in each of the last three seasons, his desperate, flapping intensity and scalding sense of injustice surely transmitted to team and crowd, wins bringing respite more than joy and anything else disaster multiplied by travesty. We can’t say it’s been the difference; we can say it isn’t helpful. This season, his air is calmer, but convincing players who’ve experienced him that previously, things were one way but now they’re another, isn’t easily done – especially when you look like you’ve not slept in several decades. More than that, though, demeanour only covers part of our impact – attitude is equally important and until that is altered, Arsenal will remain locked in the image of old Artetz, heavy on organisation and meticulousness but rizz and swag deficient. Seldom is there a sense that anyone is having any fun. Consequently, a lack of freedom we might also characterise as a lack of confidence threatens to cost them a title they’ve spurned several opportunities to near-enough secure, failing every time they’ve had a chance to increase their lead to insurmountable proportions. And now, with the gap down to just two points, they face an away derby against a Tottenham side fighting relegation and eager to impress a new manager equally eager to impress the world, having had nine days to focus solely on this game. Ultimately, Arteta has built a team guided by principles of certainty and control, problem being football is an inherently chaotic and improvisational activity. It’s true that, for a while, Pep Guardiola upended this truism, but it was only possible, for the foremost football genius of the generation, first with four of the greatest players ever, then on a budget far in excess of any competitor – and since then, even he has had to change. It’s true that Arsenal might still set-piece, blanket defence and own-goal their way to the title; if they do, they’ll be champions as deserving as any. But restart prowess and general solidity are not the opposite of expressive attacking and exuberant confidence – rather they underpin it. So, can Arteta liberate, comfort and affirm himself to give his team the same? He still has time, but also, time is not on his side – and that is what should really daunt him. Kick-off: 4.30pm GMT"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:00:41Z,My fortnight in a posture corrector: can this simple device help reduce back pain?,"When I sat at my desk this morning, I couldn’t slouch over the keyboard like I usually do. As much as I tried to hunch over, my back was held straight, shoulders pulled back. My trick? I was wearing a corset-like device with straps over my shoulders that forced me into an upright position. Posture correctors claim to provide instant improvement in posture and relieve the back, shoulder and chest pain often associated with poor posture, if worn long term. The one I have on, Vicorrect (£29.99), is one of many on the market – Lidl’s budget posture trainer (£7.99) is now sold out; Taylor Swift has been spotted wearing a sports-bra version by Forme (£140). I have a history of bad posture. I usually spend more than eight hours a day working on a laptop – sometimes at my home desk with an adjustable office chair and external monitors, but also on the sofa, at the dining table or even in bed. By the end of a typical workday, my shoulders, neck and back are painfully stiff, despite weekly trips to the gym and swimming pool to try to loosen them up. I recently visited a massage therapist, who gasped at how tight my shoulders were and told me, with a look of alarm, that I must improve my posture. An instant fix in the form of a wearable item is very appealing. But can you really “correct” your posture with a harness? David Harris, a clinical director and clinical specialist physiotherapist at Oxford Circus Physiotherapy, says they are “definitely not something I’d recommend as a standalone solution for someone with poor posture, but if they asked whether they could wear one, I would say yes – for short periods.” Traditionally, he says, good posture “is having a straight line running through your body”, where your ears are directly over your shoulders and your shoulders are directly over your hips. “But we’re busy human beings and we can’t sit in the perfect posture all day. The key is changing positions regularly. You don’t want to become reliant on a brace to stay upright.” Harris says occasionally wearing a posture corrector may benefit your proprioception – “improving your ability to sense where you are in space and getting your muscles to hold you in that position”. The corrector pulls the shoulders back, which he says could be useful “to learn the right position for your body to be in”. However, long-term, “we really want the muscles to work to hold that position, too”. And for that, muscle strengthening is essential. The Vicorrect comes with a user manual that recommends wearing the device for 30 minutes a day, building up to a maximum of three hours to “improve your alignment over time”, warning that it may cause discomfort or even pain to those not used to it. On first look, it resembles a mix between a Victorian corset and a bondage harness. It includes a back brace that sits snugly around the waist, with two hard plastic rods to ensure the back is kept straight, and when I tug on the arm straps, my shoulders are forced back. My bones click worryingly. Vicorrect doesn’t specify how long the corrector should be worn for in total – but it says at least three weeks. During my first 30 minutes, I notice a significant difference in my posture while I work, mainly because I can’t round my shoulders like I usually would. But after I take the corrector off, my posture slowly returns to its usual state. The scale of poor posture is difficult to measure. It is tough to quantify something not everyone agrees on – ideas of “good” and “bad” posture vary between cultures and time periods, and one study of 295 European physiotherapists even shows some disagreement between countries. A research paper published in 2019 argued for a re-evaluation, stating that “despite common posture beliefs, there is no strong evidence that one optimal posture exists”, and that variations in posture are more reflective of beliefs and moods than health. The impact of poor posture is also hotly debated: while there is some evidence that a forward head posture (known as “tech neck”) can cause neck pain, an umbrella review of evidence suggests that poor posture does not cause back pain. Alison McGregor, a professor of musculoskeletal biodynamics at Imperial College London, tells me that “the direct link between poor posture and back pain is actually quite tenuous”. Sitting with poor posture can be uncomfortable, she says, but it’s not usually the cause of back pain: “If anything, poor posture is a sign of weak muscles, which can also cause back issues.” Over the next few days I follow the posture corrector’s manual and increase my wearing time to 45 minutes a day. I typically throw the corrector on as soon as I start work and wear it in the privacy of my own home, but one day I forget until the evening, when I am heading out to a friend’s dinner party. The product listing states it can be worn for sitting, walking or exercising, so I put it on and head out to catch the tube. I quickly discover that wearing a posture corrector on a hot rush-hour train is a special kind of discomfort. As I’m squeezed into the back of a carriage, the back brace becomes increasingly claustrophobic. By the time I arrive at my stop, I’m covered in a thin sheen of sweat and tumble out on to the platform like a fish gasping for air. The humiliation is doubled when I show my friends the corrector and one of them says it looks like the harness she puts on her dog. The next day, I ask McGregor about the possible benefits of wearing a corrector. “It can sometimes be useful to remind people they’re slouching,” she says, “but strong muscles to support your spine are the biggest part of maintaining good posture.” She notes that this includes back muscles as well as hip, pelvis and core muscles – but warns that these “won’t develop by wearing a brace that does the work for you – they’ll just get lazier and weaker.” Spurred on by this warning, the next day I head to the gym and do reverse flies, an exercise recommended by Harris to help my rounded shoulders. I wear the corrector, as its listing claims it can be worn during workouts, but it slides uncomfortably over the fabric of my gymwear and quickly bunches up under my chest, so I take it off. Harris advises that the kind of exercise an individual should do to improve their posture varies: “It’s usually very specific, depending on what their muscle imbalance is, and it has to go hand in hand with changing environmental factors and examining any joint stiffness.” He was able to provide some tailored advice after I told him about my particular areas of pain, but recommended that anyone seeking their own workout routine should speak to a physiotherapist first. However, there are some things many people can do to improve their posture that don’t have to include a regular gym routine. “A lot of our posture is related to our behaviour – we are what we do repeatedly,” McGregor says, “so improving it can just be about restarting the body to work again.” This could include going for short walking breaks, or reminding yourself to sit upright and engage your core muscles. McGregor adds: “It’s important to break up long periods of sedentary behaviour with movement and be mindful of how you’re sitting.” The downside of behavioural changes like these is that seeing the results takes time, which could be why people are turning to devices that promise a quick fix. “Humans will inherently find the easiest way to do something, and it’s easy to slouch or sit in a comfortable chair all day,” McGregor says. For a lot of us, “the thought of having to work at our health is sometimes quite hard.” It can take six to eight weeks for exercise to start having an impact on our posture, she continues, and “human attention span often isn’t that good. We just want to take a tablet to get better.” As the fortnight draws to a close, wearing the posture corrector feels increasingly like a chore, with minimal impact on how I sit, and I’m convinced the brace around my stomach is giving me acid reflux. My posture has improved – my shoulders are more relaxed, my back is straighter – but it’s impossible to say whether it’s because the corrector has forced me into shape and made me more aware of my body, or because I went to the gym and worked on my back and core. I will keep the posture corrector for occasional use, but I’m wary of letting a device that works in place of my muscles become a new bad habit. I don’t want my back to weaken further, making me reliant on a brace to sit upright, and the lack of research linking poor posture and back pain is striking when a primary selling point of many correctors is their ability to relieve it. Perhaps regular exercise, bodily awareness and frequent movement are better than buying something that promises to do the hard work for you, no matter how tempting it may be."
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T16:00:41Z,Lib Dems call on home secretary to delay new dual national border rules,"The Liberal Democrats have called on the home secretary to “move at speed” to delay the rollout of new border controls that could result in British dual nationals being blocked from entering the country. A letter sent by the party to Shabana Mahmood echoes one sent by the former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis on Friday asking for a grace period to be implemented urgently after one of his constituents told how she could no longer visit her dying mother in a care home in Yorkshire. Families have told of flights cancelled to funerals, 80th birthday parties and visits to elderly and dying parents. Young parents who were forced to take out citizenship in the EU because of Brexit, but whose children do not yet have British passports, have also been hit. From Wednesday British dual nationals risk not being allowed to board a plane, ferry or train unless they present a current or expired British passport or a “certificate of entitlement” costing £589, which takes eight weeks to obtain. “It is unacceptable that British citizens could be penalised,” said Will Forster, the Liberal Democrat spokesperson for immigration and asylum, in the letter to Mahmood also signed by 23 other Lib Dem MPs. No British citizen should be denied the right to come home “simply because of badly-communicated and ill-thought-out administrative changes”, the letter said. It added: “I would urge you to move at speed to introduce a grace period to protect those affected.” Davis pointed out that Google trends showed a huge jump in searches for passport inquiries in the past week. Searches for “passports” were made 20,000 times, up 10% overall, but searches for “dual passports” were up 90%. He told the Guardian on Sunday: “The Home Office really has to take this seriously because a British person’s right to live or enter their own country should not be stopped by their own government, full stop. If she [Mahmood] doesn’t take this seriously, this issue will not go away and it will continue to be pursued.” One young British woman who has been in touch with the Guardian said she and her partner were considering cutting short their honeymoon in New Zealand because her husband, who is from Scotland, does not have a British passport and travelled on his New Zealand papers. “We heard about the change while out for dinner in a restaurant in Auckland and are now facing ending our honeymoon considerably early at massive expense or being stranded abroad. While trying to find any guidance or help, we’ve been passed from one government office to another with no interest or help from any,” said the woman over email. She said they had also gone to the consulate in Auckland but everyone there said “it’s nothing to do with them” and a phone line designated as “help for British people” cut out. One parent in the US trying to get a first time passport for his dual national son before a trip to see elderly parents said it was impossible to get one quickly. “Despite me being British born with a British birth certificate, we need to get original birth certificates and marriage certificates of all four grandparents. Some of those documents are close to 100 years old and the people are long since dead,” he said. Airlines are obliged to comply with rules or risk fines, making it difficult for those with flights after next Wednesday to know whether they can travel. British immigration lawyers said one solution would be to temporarily treat British dual nationals like tourists, allowing them to buy a £16 electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to get into the country. “Policy groups are calling upon the Home Office to simply allow dual nationals to apply for and hold ETAs – which is sensible. The Home Office should step back from its rollout, which is causing unnecessary deep damage to the goodwill of overseas British citizens,” said Alex Finch of Constantine Law. He pointed out that the Home Office on Friday published a partial “fix” saying that carriers may allow dual nationals to board if they have an expired British passport issued in 1989 or later along with a valid passport for a nationality eligible to apply for an ETA. “But that still leaves anyone without a qualifying expired British passport in an uncertain position,” said Finch. The Home Office said it “strongly recommends” a British passport for smooth travel. It said emergency travel documents were for available adults and children who had previously held a UK passport issued after 1 January 2006 “where the need for urgent travel meets the exceptional circumstances criteria”. It said: “From 25 February 2026, all dual British citizens will need to present either a valid British passport or certificate of ntitlement when travelling to the UK. Without one carriers cannot verify they are a British citizen, which may lead to delays or refused boarding. “Public information advising dual nationals to carry the correct documentation has been available since October 2024 and a substantive communications campaign about the introduction of ETA has been running since 2023.”"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T15:58:40Z,"Winter Olympics 2026: China’s Gu soars to gold, build-up to the closing ceremony and more – live","With USA claiming the final gold medal of the Games, here are the final standings in the Milano Cortina 2026 medal table: Jack Hughes has scored the overtime goal to give USA a slightly fortunate win in a game where Canada certainly had the best of the chances. Beau Dure was watching this one: Klaebo’s medal count hit five on the day that Mikaela Shiffrin stood at the top of the podium once again after an eight-year wait. Bryan Armen Graham on Olympic redemption for the American: Alot can happen in 12 years. If you’re Mikaela Shiffrin, as a teenager you can become the youngest ever person to win the Olympic slalom, stack a couple more medals at the next Olympics, become the most successful World Cup skier of all time with a record 108 victories, go 10 more Olympic races in a row over three Winter Games without reaching the podium, overcome the two biggest crashes of your career and subsequent battles with self-doubt and post-traumatic stress disorder and eroding trust in your own skiing, and then bring it all back home with a second Olympic slalom gold. You can also lose your dad. Shiffrin, considered by many the greatest alpine skier in history, saw her incandescent career come full circle on Wednesday beneath the jagged limestone peaks above Cortina d’Ampezzo, winning her signature race by 1.50sec – an eternity in slalom racing and the largest winning margin in any Olympic alpine skiing event in nearly three decades – to end an eight-year medal drought that had started to overtake the conversation. In 2014, at the age of 18, she became the youngest US woman ever to win Olympic gold in alpine skiing. Now, in 2026, she’s the oldest at 30. With all the fun in the mountains, Milan needed some action to make you remember it was also hosting this Olympics. It was Italy’s blades of glory who delivered as the crowd powered the host nation to another gold medal. Davide Ghiotto, Andrea Giovannini and Michele Malfatti thrashed the world record-holders, world champions and favourites Casey Dawson, Emery Lehman and Ethan Cepuran of the US to win the men’s team pursuit gold medal in speed skating. Buoyed by raucous cheering from the home crowd, the Italians won their country’s first Olympic title in this event since the Turin Games in 2006, beating the Americans by a whopping 4.51sec – a lifetime in speed skating. As we continue our Winter Olympics lookback, there was to be more heartbreak for Kirsty Muir as she once again fell agonsingly short of a medal. Sean Ingle was in Livigno: This time, Kirsty Muir must surely have believed that a Winter Olympic medal was in her grasp. But as a thrilling big air competition reached its denouement, an Italian with no anterior cruciate ligament in her right knee came down a 180‑feet ramp and drove a stake through the Briton’s heart. It all looked so promising when the 21-year-old from Aberdeen landed a stunning left double 1620, with four and a half rotations, to move into the medal positions after two of the three rounds. However, with just four jumps of the competition remaining, Flora Tabanelli, who tore her ACL in November, did the same trick as Muir but only better to score 94.25 points to steal the bronze medal. “It was a little bit bittersweet,” said Muir, who fell on her final jump and finished fourth. “I didn’t know what she did, but I knew it bumped my score by a decent amount and therefore I really did have to go for it. I gave it my all and I’m taking that with me. We still have one more gold medal to hand out and it’s in the men’s ice hockey. We’re going to overtime after it finished 1-1 between Canada and the USA after three periods. Beau Dure is covering that one here: Day nine was a golden one for Team GB: Team GB chiefs have hailed Britain’s greatest day at a Winter Olympics after celebrating two gold medals, in the mixed snowboard cross and mixed team skeleton in Milano Cortina. Super Sunday started with Charlotte Bankes and Huw Nightingale storming to a surprise victory in Livigno, with Bankes dramatically overtaking the French team with four turns remaining to take mixed snowboard cross gold. Less than five hours later, Tabitha Stoecker and Matt Weston added a second British gold in the mixed team skeleton in Cortina after Weston overturned a 0.30sec deficit following Stoecker’s run to beat Germany by 0.17sec. Elsewhere the Johannes Høsflot Klæbo gold medal count was up to four as he led Norway to victory in the men’s 4 x 7.5km cross-country relay at the Milano Cortina Games on Sunday to win a record ninth career gold medal at the Winter Olympics. The 29-year-old has won four gold medals at these Games and is widely expected to take another two in the men’s team sprint on Wednesday and 50km classic race on Saturday. Klæbo took over for the final leg with a lead of 12.2 seconds and extended it to 22.2 seconds by the time he crossed the line. France took silver and the bronze went to Italy. Sean Ingle has racked up some miles across northern Italy over the last few weeks, on day eight he was in Bormio where Brazil, yes Brazil, won an Alpine skiing gold medal: As the snow fell in Bormio, and the fog settled in, Lucas Pinheiro Braathen made history by becoming the first South American to win a Winter Olympic medal. Then, as the realisation that he had won gold for Brazil in the men’s giant slalom, he collapsed to the floor and allowed the tears to flow. “I just hope that Brazilians look at this and truly understand that your difference is your superpower,” he said, still sobbing away. “It may show up in your skin or in the way you dress. But I hope this inspires every kid out there who feels a bit different to trust who you are.” Erin Jackson of USA competes in the women’s 1000m speed skating; Sweden’s Elis Lundholm competes in the freestyle skiing women’s moguls qualifiers; Philipp Raimund of Germany celebrates after landing during the men’s normal hill individual final On the back of his helmet, Pinheiro Braathen has in big letters “Vamos Dancar” – “Let’s Dance.” And he certainly did that on his first run, establishing a stunning 0.95sec lead over the Swiss legend Marco Odermatt. One week into the Winter Games and Team GB had its first medal, a golden one at that. Matt Weston was the man to do it, in the skeleton. The 28-year-old broke the track record at the Cortina Sliding Centre four times in succession, and won in a combined time of 3min 43.33sec, which was almost a full second ahead of the runner-up, Germany’s Axel Jungk. “I’ve been fortunate enough to win world championships, and European championships and other things, and this blows them all out the water,” Weston said. “I almost feel numb. I keep touching this medal to make sure it is real.” In Milan, American figure skating icon Ilia Malinin fell twice as Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov stunned the field to win Olympic gold. Bryan Armen Graham was at the Milano Ice Skating Arena: For nearly two years, Ilia Malinin has made men’s figure skating feel predictable in the most spectacular of ways. On Friday night on the southern outskirts of Milan, the Olympic Games reminded the sport, and perhaps Malinin himself, that predictability is never guaranteed on its biggest stage. The overwhelming favorite entering the free skate, the 21-year-old American instead saw the Olympic title slip away to Kazakhstan’s Mikhail Shaidorov after an error-strewn performance that will go down among the biggest shocks in figure skating history. Shaidorov’s season-best total of 291.58 vaulted him from fifth after the short program as one favored contender after another faltered. Japan’s Yuma Kagiyama (280.06) and Shun Sato (274.90) took silver and bronze respectively on a night where even the sport’s most reliable jump technicians struggled to hold their programs together. Indeed a storm did brew and on day six, it hit. Sean Ingle and Andy Bull were both across this one: Vladyslav Heraskevych has accused the International Olympic Committee of doing Russia’s propaganda for them after he was barred from racing in the Winter Games because he wanted to wear a “helmet of memory” in honour of Ukraine’s war dead. In one of the most controversial decisions in recent Olympic history, the Ukrainian skeleton racer was informed only minutes before he was due to compete that his accreditation had been rescinded. It followed a last-ditch meeting in Cortina on Thursday morning with the IOC’s president, Kirsty Coventry, who left in tears after she failed to persuade Heraskevych to change his mind. The IOC has maintained all week that the helmet, which shows the images of 24 athletes and children that died from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, violates its athletes’ charter because the field of play must be free from political expression. However Heraskevych, who had a genuine chance of winning Ukraine’s first medal at these Winter Olympics, has insisted that the helmet is an act of remembrance for the friends he has lost and that it would be a “betrayal” to back down. There was storm brewing on day five and it would be one that made the IOC look like the kind of out-of-touch sports body stuffed with dusty suits that everyone assumes it is. Here is Sean Ingle’s report: The Ukrainian skeleton racer Vladyslav Heraskevych says he is ready to be disqualified on Thursday because he does not want to betray his country’s dead athletes. In what is likely to be an extraordinary scene in Cortina when the skeleton begins at 9.30am local time (8.30am GMT), Heraskevych has vowed to wear his “helmet of memory”, even though the International Olympic Committee has told him it will kick him out if he does so. Heraskevych has continued to practise in the helmet, which shows 20 images of athletes and children killed since Russia’s invasion, despite the IOC banning it on Monday. “I will not betray these athletes,” Heraskevych said after finishing first on the final day of practice. “These athletes sacrificed their lives and because of this sacrifice I am able to be here so I will not betray them.” Day four and the big question for Johannes Høsflot Klæbo was could he win all six cross-country medals on offer? He was making other world-class athletes look as if they were chasing shadows. Klæbo cruised through the sprint classic and detonated the field on the final climb to claim his second gold of these Games. However, Klæbo was not even the biggest story in the Norwegian team at this point. Sturla Holm Lægreid broke down in tears after winning bronze in the men’s 20km biathlon, apologising for having an affair and saying: “It has been the worst week of my life.” Johan-Olav Botn won gold, with the Frenchman Éric Perrot in second, but it was Lægreid who stunned television viewers in Norway after opening up to the broadcaster NRK about his private life over the past six months. “There is something I want to share with someone who may not be watching today,” he said. “Half a year ago I met the love of my life. The world’s most beautiful and nicest person. Three months ago I made the mistake of my life and cheated on her, and I told her about that a week ago. This has been the worst week of my life. “I had the gold medal in life, and I am sure there are many people who will see things differently, but I only have eyes for her. Sport has come second these last few days. Yes, I wish I could share this with her.” “I’ll be proud of myself in a minute,” the 21-year-old Team GB star Kirsty Muir told one reporter, through the sobs and the pain. “But I’m in a bit of a hole right now.” Muir had finished fourth in the women’s freeski slopestyle competition, the first of several near-misses for the British contingent and Sean Ingle was in Livigno: Everyone knows that fourth is the worst place to finish at an Olympics. But, for Kirsty Muir, this result stung like pouring a gallon of antiseptic on an open sore. Coming into this final, Muir knew she was a strong favourite for a medal. She had won this event at the X Games two weeks ago with a score of 93.66, before qualifying third here. On this day, it just wasn’t to be. Instead the Swiss star Mathilde Gremaud defended her Olympic title with a score of 86.96 points, while China’s Eileen Gu repeated her second place in Beijing with 86.48. While Muir knew she was not at her best, she felt that bronze was there for the taking. Day two was dominated by one dramatic incident 13 seconds into Lindsey Vonn’s attempt to win a miraculous medal as she raced with a complete ACL rupture in her left knee, along with a bone bruise and meniscal damage sustained a week before in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Here was Andy Bull’s take from Cortina: The Olympic career of Lindsey Vonn has ended in a sickening, split-second crash high on the side of the Tofane downhill run in Cortina d’Ampezzo. The American, one of the most successful skiers in history, had come out of a five-year retirement to compete in her fifth Games, and was hoping to become the oldest athlete, male or female, to win a medal in the downhill. Vonn was just 12 seconds into the race when her legs gave way beneath her as she rode a bump. She twisted, fell, and tumbled and, after the first stunned screams and shouts, the crowd all around the mountain fell silent in shock and worry. The USA team confirmed later that she was in a “stable condition and in good hands” following surgery after breaking her left leg. Her teammate Breezy Johnson was in the leader’s seat when Vonn went down. She covered her eyes because she couldn’t watch. Johnson, 30, was forced out of the last Olympic Games in Beijing after she had a bad crash here on this very same slope. She went on to win the gold in 1min 36.10sec, just four hundredths of a second ahead of Germany’s Emma Aicher in second. The home favourite Sofia Goggia, who lit the Olympic cauldron during the opening ceremony, was third. But the abiding memory of this race will always be the sight of Vonn on a stretcher, being evacuated from the mountain by air ambulance. Continuing with our rewind, day one brought an early gold for hosts Italy with the remarkable story of Francesca Lollobrigida. The silver medalist from Beijing 2022, struck gold for the first time in her fourth Olympics in the women’s 3,000m speed skating. Lollobrigida’s two-year-old Tommaso was hurried towards the ice to celebrate with his mother. In the mountains Franjo von Allmen was the last Swiss skier standing on the podium of the men’s downhill after an assault by an Italian team. Von Allmen won gold but the home crowd in Bormio enjoyed Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris filling out the rest of the podium at the expense of pre-race favourite Marco Odermatt and Alexis Monney. Sweden also made a big splash on day one, with a one-two in the skiathlon as Frida Karlsson and Ebba Andersson took gold and silver respectively. What was your favourite moment of Milano Cortina 2026? Get in touch via the link at the top of the page. Hello all, the players are back on the ice for the second period in the ice hockey. Follow that one with Beau Dure: That is all from me today. Tom Bassam is back to take you through memory lane. It began with an opening ceremony at San Siro that showcased Italy’s rich cultural history of music, art, fashion and dance. The overarching theme was harmony – brining together what was different. Sean Ingle wrote: In the buildup, the creative director, Marco Balich, had promised that his team of artists and performers had devoted 700 hours of rehearsals to ensure everything would be perfect. They delivered – and then some. The show began with 70 dancers from Accademia del Teatro alla Scala, twirling and spinning in perfect time, across a background of classical statues. Soon there were also nods to Ancient Rome and the Renaissance, food and fashion, literature and design. There were also genuflections to Verdi, Puccini, Rossini and Armani. There were supermodels in red, green and white, the colours of the Italian flag, walking down a catwalk before the Italian national anthem was played. There was even a surreal section devoted to hand gestures – although none of the ones that are usually seen in Milan rush hour. These Games have been a joy to watch for winter sport experts but equally for those who tune in every four years and had to frantically Google: “What is ski mountaineering?” and “Why do Norway win every gold medal in existence?”. Emma John’s questions include: “Are Ed Leigh and Tim Warwood actually a disguised Joaquin Phoenix and Timothée Chalamet, deep in character for an upcoming reboot of Wayne’s World?” and “Are Canadians not the nice guys any more?”. Ice hockey: The Americans draw first blood against Canada! After breakaway and some deft puck handling, Matt Boldy puts his side ahead with their first shot on goal. Auston Matthews and Quinn Hughes assists. Follow along below for full updates. It was a slow start for Team Italy at Milano Cortina but once the hosts began to pick up medals in the second week, the public’s imagination was captured. Angela Giuffrida writes from Rome: If the streets in the Italian capital felt largely bereft of Olympics fever, the numbers told a different story. More than 1.27m spectators who had bought tickets by the event’s midway point, filling venues to an average 85% of their available capacity. For what has been the most geographically scattered Winter Olympics ever, that was no small feat. Held under the official banner of Milano Cortina, the Games stretched across almost 8,500 square miles, encompassing Alpine villages in Lombardy such as Bormio and Livigno, along with Anterselva and Val di Fiemme in Trentino-Alto Adige, before wrapping up with Sunday’s closing ceremony in Verona. The vast footprint presented complex logistical challenges for its organisers and athletes, and provided no single hub for its spectators to celebrate. Speaking to reporters last week, Andrea Varnier, the Milano Cortina Games chief executive, said: “We know that this is not a walk in the park.” He added: “We are completely aware that we are pioneers when it comes to this edition of the Games. We knew that we had many challenges and, after one week, most of them seem to have been overcome.” Read the full feature on how Italy fell in love with their home Games below. The Milano Cortina Games surpassed expectations despite a large number of obstacles in the run-up to the world’s biggest winter multi-sports event, the International Olympic Committee said on Sunday, ahead of the closing ceremony. The Games, which started on 6 February with a dazzling opening ceremony at San Siro in Milan, were under extreme pressure for years due to tight deadlines and a number of building delays, with the widely dispersed venues across northern Italy posing additional challenges for organisers. But when the curtain falls with the closing ceremony in the arena of Verona, organisers and the IOC can breathe a sigh of relief. “They have been fantastic,” the IOC president, Kirsty Coventry, said in her address to members at the Olympic body’s session. “It could not happen without incredible teamwork … and we had it every step of the way.” “Over the last two weeks we have seen and experienced incredible Games. I have no words really,” said Coventry, presiding over her first Games after her election last year. It was a completely different picture only a few weeks before the start, with organisers scrambling to complete the Santagiulia ice hockey arena as well as the newly built sliding centre in Cortina d’Ampezzo, a hotly debated project throughout preparations due to the cost and tight construction deadlines. “These have been very challenging, difficult years for a series of circumstances,” the Games chief, Giovanni Malago, said. “We never tried to find alibis. But we are all satisfied.” Despite vocal IOC opposition, Italy decided midway through preparations in 2023 to build a new sliding centre in Cortina. The IOC had suggested that organisers could shift the competition to another country and an existing sliding centre but the Italian government refused. It opted instead to build a new one, piling more pressure on the embattled organisers and angering the IOC. A series of protests took place on the day the Games began in the Italian financial capital to oppose the presence of analysts from a department that falls under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) while the US vice-president JD Vance, present at the opening ceremony, was booed when shown on the stadium’s big screens. Such were the IOC’s concerns before the Games that when Malago, an IOC member, ran for a spot on the Olympic body’s executive board on the eve of the opening ceremony, he failed spectacularly. Around 48 fellow members voted against him in a clear snub. It is extremely rare for an IOC member of a host nation to face such opposition from fellow members prior to staging the Games. But when the Olympics got under way most operations went off without any major problems, surprising organisers. While Olympics traditionally struggle with teething problems or more serious issues that can affect venue operations or even a lack of atmosphere, the Games in Italy did not face a major crisis while the winter weather played along to offer impressive snowy Alpine backdrops. Initial transport concerns between Milan and the mountain clusters in the Dolomites eased almost instantly, mainly due to the limited number of spectators commuting between the two because of the long travel times that can reach six or seven hours. Most fans chose to stay in either Milan or in the mountains. The European time zone of the Games also meant increased viewership across the continent and the key market of North America, compared to the previous two winter editions held in Asia. The Games also got a major boost domestically with Italy picking up 30 medals, including 10 golds by Sunday morning, to make the top five on the medals table, and increased viewership and ticket sales during the Games with several hundred thousand sold during the competitions, to bring the total to about 1.5 million from 1.2 million at the start of the Games. “Thank you for never ceasing to believing in us,” Malago said. “For supporting us in the most difficult moments and there were not a few. Together we were stronger than any challenge and any adversity.” Here, we will be looking back at the last two weeks of sporting action and looking ahead to tonight’s closing ceremony. In the meantime, get in touch via the email at the top of the blog and send over your most memorable moment from these Games. Ice hockey: I will be providing key moments from the men’s ice hockey final but if you want full updates, follow along with Beau Dure in our dedicated live blog. If you’re just joining us, here is what has happened so far on the final day of the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympic Games: Eileen Gu defended her Olympic ski half-pipe title to make it six medals in six events over her Winter Games career. The 22-year-old Gu is already the most decorated freeskier in the short history of the sport at the Olympics. She won the event on the strength of her second run, a clean, technically sound pass and got even better in her final run to finish with a score of 94.75. Her teammate, Li Fanghui, took silver and Zoe Atkin of Britain was third, upping GB’s medal tally to five. Sweden’s Ebba Andersson surged away from her rivals to secure a commanding win in the 50km classic cross-country ski race, winning the first gold medal in the event on its Olympic debut. It was redemption for Andersson, who suffered a series of falls in the relay that likely cost her team a gold medal. She also has three second-place finishes at Milano Cortina, one earned after an impressive comeback in the relay and individual silvers in the skiathlon and 10km freestyle event. Germany’s Johannes Lochner collected his second bobsleigh gold of these Games in the four-man event, completing a hugely dominant week for the sliding superpower. Compatriot and double-defending champion Francesco Friedrich took silver but Germany’s hopes of a first-ever clean sweep in the event were spoiled when Michael Vogt snatched bronze for Switzerland on the final run. Sweden beat Switzerland for women’s curling gold to conclude the sport’s competition at Milano Cortina. It was Sweden’s sixth curling Olympic gold and 13th medal overall the sport, trailing only Canada in both categories. After upsetting top-ranked Canada in the semi-finals Anna Hasselborg’s Sweden defeated Silvana Tirinzoni’s Switzerland 6-5. Canada beat the United States for bronze on Saturday. Sidney Crosby is out for Canada in the men’s Olympic hockey gold medal game against the United States after a right knee injury. Crosby skated in a closed practice on Saturday. The 38-year-old left Canada’s quarter-final against the Czech Republic and missed the semi-final against Finland. Connor McDavid wears the captain’s “C” again. He leads the tournament with 13 points in five games. The final stone dislodges Switzerland’s red and there it is. Sweden win 6-5 to win their second Olympic gold eight years on. What a result for Anna Hasselborg and her team! Curling: Sweden are just hitting their shots perfectly. Switzerland have one last chance to disrupt the yellow stone in the middle … Curling: Huge end for the Swiss as they score two to level it all up against Sweden – 5-5 as we go to the 10th end. Bobsleigh: The Great Britain pilot, Brad Hall, speaks to BBC Sport after a seventh-place finish in the four-man bobsleigh: It’s very difficult to put into words to be honest. It’s pretty devastating to finish where we did today but we weren’t in the place we wanted to be overnight and we said we were going to come out fighting and do the best we can – and that’s what we feel like we did. It didn’t work out the way we wanted it to but we have so much to be proud of over the past four years – world championships medals, European champions and World Cup medals as well so, it’s just sucks to end a four-year Olympic period with a result like this. It’s difficult to put into words right now. Curling: Sweden steal one in the women’s final after an error from Switzerland’s Alina Pätz with the hammer. The Swedes now lead 5-3 with two ends left to make up for it. Ice hockey: Some big breaking news for the men’s ice hockey final. Canada’s captain, Sidney Crosby is out of the gold-medal game against the United States. The two-time Olympic champion, will play no part due to an injury sustained in the quarter-final win over the Czech Republic after a heavy hit from the defenceman Radko Gudas. The 38-year-old has two goals and four assists in four games this tournament. Connor McDavid will continue to wear the ‘C’ in Crosby’s absence. You can follow our dedicated live blog for the final with Beau Dure below. Gold for Johannes Lochner and his team, as the Beijing 2022 gold and silver medallist pilots swap places in 2026! That is a fifth Olympic gold for Thorsten Margis, part of Lochner’s crew. He won two-man and four-man gold in 2018 and 2022 as part of Friedrich’s team. Francesco Friedrich (Germany) takes silver and it is bronze for Michael Vogt’s Switzerland sled! Great Britain’s team comprising pilot Brad Hall, Greg Cackett, Leon Greenwood and Taylor Lawrence finish seventh. Thanks Tom and hello all. Let’s see how those medals shake up then … Right, to see you through to the conclusion of this one is Yara El-Shaboury. I’ll be back in a bit. Ammour can’t go clean for the Germany third team and that guarantees a bronze for the Swiss! The third German team post a 3mins 38.68secs overall time. The fourth-place Swiss put down their quickest start and Vogt delivers in the pilot seat. They’ve put the pressure on Ammour’s German unit in the bronze medal position, with an overall time of 3mins 38.64secs. Big roar for Baumgartner’s crew go for Italy, but they’re losing time all the way down and can’t move up from fifth. Unfortunately Hall can’t go quicker, it’s not his cleanest run and the British four finish in 55.03 for a total time of 3mins 39.12secs. It looks like a seventh-place finish for Team GB. Follador’s team for Switzerland go down in 54.94 so their four-run total is 3mins 39.03secs. Brad Hall’s GB team were on the same time ahead of that Swiss run, can they go better? Now we’re turning our focus back to the bobsleigh. Here’s the top five ahead of the final runs: Germany (Lochner) - 2mins 42.86secs Germany (Friedrich) - 2mins 43.34secs (+0.48secs) Germany (Ammour) - 2mins 43.78secs (+0.92secs) Switzerland (Vogt) - 2mins 43.87secs (+1.01secs) Italy (Baumgartner) - 2mins 43.96secs (+1.10secs) Switzerland and Team GB are joint sixth on 2mins 44.09secs (+1.23secs off the lead) Quick update on the curling. We’re into the sixth end and the Swedes lead Switzerland 3-1. For a full look at the updated medal table, hop over to our live page here. Email from Chris Page: Gutted for Zoe, but very proud. I think the judges were unnecessarily harsh. But my mind is now turning to the upcoming Paralympics, especially the Wheelchair Curling. It requires even more skill and finesse than the non-disabled variety, as there’s no sweeping involved. Let me know your thoughts on the action via the link at the top of the page. Cross country is a mad sport, 49km of gruelling skiing and then a sprint uphill. Super human athletes. Right, here are the final places in the cross country: Ebba Andersson (SWE) Heidi Weng (NOR) Nadja Kälin (CHE) Here comes Diggins, but she can’t get past Fosnæs on the climb. Kälin still leads this mini-race and is pulling away. It’s bronze for Kälin! Nadja Kälin of Switzerland has a little lead going into the last climb and Kristin Austgulen Fosnæs of Norway is just behind her. Jessie Diggins of USA is on their tale, she could go past on this incline. Norway’s Weng comes in to take silver, who will take bronze? This will comes down to a sprint. Andersson goes into Klaebo mode on the final climb and enters the stadium all alone. She’s been the silver lady so far in this Games, but now gets her golden moment. Taking a brief switch over the cross country, Sweden’s Ebba Andersson has a huge lead with less than 5km to go. She well away for gold and Heidi Weng has a decent gap for second, but the shake up for bronze could be interesting with five athletes all in with a shout. So after a fall on her first run, Gu shows nerves of steel to improve with each of her next two runs. Zoe Atkin led after the first runs but despite improving her score to 92.5 on her final effort she falls just short of Li Fanghui, who bagged silver. Here are the final standings: Eileen Gu (CH) 94.75 Li Fanghui (CH) 93 Zoe Atkin (GB) 92.50 She put it all out there, the height was massive and she lands a switch 900 to finish but the judges only gave her 92.50, meaning she’s 0.50 short of silver. That’s Team GB’s fifth medal of the Games, adding to the three golds and one silver. Zoe Atkin goes for gold.. Li Fanghui is guaranteed a medal, will this see her move into gold? It’s clean, technical and greater difficulty than her second run. That’s a 93, meaning Zoe Atkin needs slightly more to move up from bronze. Indra Brown puts in her best run, she’s a long way off the medals at the moment, but will that change? She goes to 87, for fifth place. Eileen Gu shuns the 1080 but her run is better than the one that scored 94 but it only improves her scored by 0.75. The task for Zoe Atkin and Li Fanghui is not impossible but is a little bit harder. The BBC boys are surprised that doesn’t score higher. Zhang Kexin is yet to land a run, but she can put up big scores. Ooooo, that’s the first 1080 we’ve seen in this final and that was an impressive technical run. It wasn’t big on the height and the score of 83.25 reflects that. What can Amy Fraser do? She’s fourth currently and that’s a big run. There was a lot of switch tricks in there but not a lot of height. It’s good enough for 88 and that won’t win a medal for the Canadian. This is good, Svea Irving skipped the second run after a bang on the first run and I thought she was out, instead the American is going to give it a go. Unfortunately she calls it early after fighting the landing on her second trick. Rachael Karker is next, but she falls coming off her jump. The Canadian’s 79.50 puts her in fifth for now. There’s no improvement from Mischa Thomas, she finishes with a best of 77.75. We’re into the third runs and Kate Gray get down her first full run. The American gets a 66.5. Liu Yishan is next and she improves her score to 71.75 but that’s not troubling the podium. After getting a huge 5.4m on the first jump she takes a fall halfway down. Such a shame she was looking very good for an improved score. More to come on run three, you hope. So after the second runs the medal positions are: Eileen Gu (CH) 94 Li Fanghui (CH) 91.50 Zoe Atkin (GB) 90.50 Li Fanghui appears to take a bit of a slip coming off her first trick and also misses a grab but again the judges overlook those execution errors because of the technichality on show. The Chinese athlete goes second with a 91.50. Indra Brown’s second run is better than her first, but only by ten points. Paying for a lack of airtime. Gu makes it down this time and even though there’s a missed grab in there it’s still packed full of hits. It’s not got the height of Zeo Atkin’s run, but finishes with back-to-back alley-oops, so how will they score it? Wow 94. Gu goes into gold medal position. We have a final. Zhang Kexin is next and is putting together something very impressive before she takes a huge fall. Eileen Gu is next. Sadly, Svea Irving’s fall in run one has put her out of the rest of the competition. Rachael Karker of Canada this time manages to land her run and the BBC commentary lads are suprised as she’s given a 79.50 to go ahead of Thomas into fourth. Amy Fraser, the Canadian sitting second, puts down a similar run to the first and doesn’t improve her score. Mischa Thomas seems like a character. The New Zealander doesn’t clock it’s her turn to go until the camera switches on to her, before she drops her phone halfway down the run. A camera man grabs it for her as the judges decide she didn’t improve on her first round 77.75. Kate Gray falls on second run and doesn’t improve her score, then Liu Yishan puts down another clean run, but not one that is massively better than her first. That is what the doctor ordered! Huge first trick from Atkin gets 4.5m of air and her average of 2.7m is higher than the peaks achieved by anyone else in the final! Do the judges love it? They do! It’s 90.5, easily the best score so far. So after the first runs the medal positions are: Zoe Atkin (GB) 90.50 Amy Frasher (CAN) 85 Li Fanggui (CH) 81.25 We lost Canada’s Cassie Sharpe to concussion before the final so we move next to Li Fanghui of China. It’s a good one, a lot of switch, which apparently the judges love. That’s an 81.25 and good enough for second. Only Amy Fraser has put down anything of top quality so far, but what can Zoe Atkin do? Australia’s Indra Brown starts well but loses momentum, it’s a clean run but not the biggest. It’s only a 55.4, but that’s good enough for fourth with the amount of falls we’ve seen so far. Wow! Eileen Gu goes off next and she pulls up after first trick. Pressure on for the Chinese athlete as she has to score with her second and third runs. Zhang Kexin rides more of the pipe backwards than forwards before falling. That’s better from Amy Fraser. The Canadian is clean and technically really strong, she misses a couple of grabs but that’s the best so far, 85. We have more falls as Canada’s Rachael Karker and then Team USA’s Svea Irving both hit the deck. This final was postponed from last night due to heavy snow so these conditions are not easy. Liu Yishan, the first of the four Chinese athletes, is clean but not the highest scoring at 70. Mischa Thomas is next for New Zealand, the BBC commentary boys like it (when do they not?), and it’s good enough for a 77.75. It’s not her best, with a stumble on the last trick for a 44.55. She has two more runs to improve that score. First to put down a run is America’s Kate Gray… We’re heading over to Livigno shortly for the women’s halfpipe. Team GB’s Zoe Atkin qualified first but there is plenty of competition, not least from China’s Eileen Gu. Some big news coming out of the 50km women’s cross-country skiing, with Frida Karlsson pulling out. The Swede was the gold meal favourite having won the skiathlon and the 10km intervals, as well as a silver in 4x7.5km relay. The Americans have a disaster run there. They’ve lost more than a second, largely as a result of a huge tap and fishtail coming out of the start ramp. They’ll be tumbling down the rankings. I’ll have those standings in full later ahead of the fourth and final runs. Brad Hall’s Team GB are next. They get off quick with 4.78 start but with perfection required this is a little short. There are a couple of errors in turns one and two, with speed not picking up further down the course. The time of 54.66secs is much better than their second run (55.04) but Lochner’s team is further off in the distance, 1.23secs ahead. Team GB are only 0.31 seconds behind third-placed Ammour’s third-place German crew but that’s a lot to ask in one run. The Swiss are less clean with their run, but they post their second-quickest time (54.69) which sees them lose ground on the team above them. The Swiss are down in 54.55, quicker than Ammour’s sled in the third run but not quick enough to move up into the medal positions. Neither can the Italians, who get down in a tidy fashion but a lack of speed out of the gate sees them post a 54.57 and remain a couple of hundredths off bronze. Next up… more Germans. Adam Ammour is the pilot for this one and that is (relatively) less impressive than his rivals. That run opens the door for the bronze medal spot, they’re 0.96 behind Lochner’s crew. Lochner’s team start 0.6secs faster than Lochner’s team but he’s losing time further down the track and the 54.30secs finishing time means the time advantage for the leaders grows to 0.48secs. We’re straight into it with the four-man bobsleigh. The leaders, the Johannes Lochner’s German crew are down in 54.25, not his best but not far off. Now what can Francesco Friedrich do with Germany’s second-place team? This is the end, sadly. Day 16 is here and with it, the closing ceremony. But that’s later and for now we still have a final few events to tick off, with medals to be handed out. One of those medals may even go the way of Team GB’s Zoe Atkin, in the delayed women’s ski halfpipe final. Before that we have the final runs in the men’s four-man bobsleigh, where – unsurprisingly – Germany lead and also sit in silver medal position. Brad Hall’s British crew are seventh. Later on we have what the second installment of what is argualy the most gruelling event in the whole Games, the 50km cross-country ski mass start. After Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won his sixth gold of the Games in the men’s event yesterday, today it is the turn of the women to push themselves uphill on skis for more than two hours (sounds fun). Another high-profile event concludes today with a showstopper of a final in the men’s ice-hockey as the USA take on Canada in a re-run of the feisty Four Nations finale from last year. Canada beat the USA for bronze in the women’s curling yesterday and the gold medal match starts just after midday, with Switzlerland facing Sweden. I think that’s everything covered off, shall we get into it?"
2026-02-22,2026-02-22T15:39:40Z,Huckabee’s Israel land remarks condemned as ‘dangerous and inflammatory’,"Governments from across the Islamic world have condemned remarks by the US ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, suggesting it would “be fine” for Israel to claim a broad swath of the Middle East. Huckabee, an evangelical Christian pastor and former Arkansas governor, has long been an outspoken supporter of Israeli settlements in occupied Palestinian territories. In an interview with the conservative US commentator Tucker Carlson published on Friday, the ambassador pointed to verses in the Bible that some Jews and evangelical Christians interpret as signifying the divine right of Jews to claim the land from the Nile to the Euphrates. “It would be fine if they took it all. But I don’t think that’s what we’re talking about here today,” Huckabee said, suggesting that it was Israeli restraint that prevented the Jewish state from exercising its biblical claim. “We’re talking about this land that the state of Israel now lives in and wants to have peace in,” the ambassador said. “They’re not trying to take over Jordan, they’re not trying to take over Syria, they’re not trying to take over Iraq or anywhere else. They want to protect their people.” Huckabee later admitted his remark had been “somewhat of a hyperbolic statement”. But the suggestion that Jews had a divine right to a large part of the Middle East drew a furious response from Muslim governments around the world. A joint statement signed by a list of countries including Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Turkey, Indonesia and Pakistan, said the ambassador’s comments were “dangerous and inflammatory remarks, which constitute a flagrant violation of the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and pose a grave threat to the security and stability of the region.” The US embassy in Israel insisted the comments had been taken out of context by the states making the complaint. “US policy has not changed,” the embassy said in a statement. “The narrative was based on an edited portion of a response. If one listens to the full context Ambassador Huckabee clearly says that Israel has no desire to change their current boundaries. Any characterization otherwise is a misrepresentation of the full and unedited response.” In other comments in what appeared to be an unedited video of the interview with Huckabee that Carlson published online, the ambassador appeared to claim that the roughly 60% of the West Bank under direct Israeli control (known as Area C) was an integral part of Israel, in apparent contradiction to Washington’s official position opposing annexation of any or all of the occupied territories. “Area C is Israel,” Huckabee said. The ambassador also gave an expansive interpretation of the biblical areas of Judea and Samaria, ancient geographical terms that Israel uses to refer to the West Bank. Huckabee seemed to go even further. “Well, you basically take the Jordan River, and it’s west of the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to the Lebanon border,” Huckabee said, again suggesting that Israel had been generous in ceding territory. “Israel did have control of the Sinai. They gave that to Egypt. They had control of it. They gave it away in 1979 in the peace agreement. “Israel has shrunk the land. They have made that decision,” he said. “That’s why they gave away Gaza. They’ve given away a lot of things.” The often tense and combative interview illustrated a rift within the US right over how far the US should go in its support for Israel. Carlson challenged Huckabee repeatedly on whether his claim of the biblical rights of all Jews to settle in the territory between the sea and the River Jordan was defined ethnically or religiously. Huckabee appeared to argue that it was both, meaning that someone who was born Jewish but converted out of the faith held the right to settle there, as well as someone who converted to Judaism."
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:35:45Z,US dollar and European stock markets drop after Trump announces 15% global tariff – business live,"Despite the heightened uncertainty, the supreme court ruling gives Trump “an off ramp from his tariff intensive strategy ahead of the midterm elections”, argues analysts at Unicredit. Unicredit told clients this morning: Last Friday, the US Supreme Court ruled, in a 6-3 decision, that the tariffs US President Donald Trump enacted under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) are illegal. This covers around 70% of all additional tariffs Trump has imposed during his second term, including the so-called “reciprocal” tariffs on almost all countries that were announced on “Liberation Day” and additional tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China related to illegal fentanyl. The Trump administration responded over the weekend – invoking Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 by declaring a balance of payments crisis to impose a 15% tariff on almost all countries that will last 150 days, unless Congress decides to extend it, which seems unlikely. The new tariffs exclude certain critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, USMCA-compliant goods from Canada and Mexico (which are covered by a free trade agreement), and those sectors subject to tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (e.g. cars, steel and aluminium). Manufacturers are among the fallers on Germany’s DAX stock index this morning. Carmaker BMW’s shares are down 1.4%, Daimler Truck has dropped by 1.1% and Airbus has lost 1%. The Dutch market is also lower, pulling Amsterdam’s AEX index down by 0.4%. France and Germany’s stock markets have been hit by US trade uncertainty too. In Frankfurt, the DAX index has dropped by 0.6%, as traders fret that Europe’s trade deal with the US may unravel. France’s CAC 40 index is starting the new week in the red too, dipping by 0.35%. Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, says: Tariff developments have turned the situation into an unholy mess, prompting far more questions than answers. After the Supreme Court ruled against the President’s tariffs, the implications are far from clear. No reference was apparently made in the ruling as to whether the monies raised from tariffs so far would need to be repaid and, even if this is the case, whether the refunds would go to companies or the ultimate customer who will have suffered higher prices. To further compound the confusion, the President immediately invoked a different Act and announced that he would impose a blanket 10% global tariff, which he raised to 15% the following day. This brings another level of uncertainty given the trade deals which are already in place, although spokespeople from the White House implied that these would remain in place, which seems to contradict the Supreme Court ruling. The London stock market has dipped slightly in early trading. The FTSE 100 index is down 19 points, or 0.18%, at 10,668 points. That’s despite a rally in precious metal producers (following the jump in gold and silver this morning) and miners (as the weaker dollar lifts commodity prices). Gold has jumped to a three-week high, as the uncertainty over US trade policy drives investors into safe-haven assets. Gold is up by 0.6% to $5,135 an ounce, its highest level since the end of January. Silver is up 1.2% to its highest level in over two weeks. Asia-Pacific stock markets have already reacted to the latest tariff developments. Australia’s stock market has dropped by 0.6%, as investors recognise that the new 15% global tariff will hurt its exporters. But with mainland Chinese markets closed for the lunar new year, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index has surged by 2.4%. That follows analysis (see here) showing that China is one of the countries who should benefit most from the new global tariff. Tony Sycamore, market analyst at IG, explains: Even after President Trump’s swift response—announcing a new 10% global tariff (quickly raised to 15%) under Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, effective February 24, the net tariff on Chinese goods is still lower than it was before the Court ruling. Most estimates suggest that China will see a net reduction in tariffs of roughly 5–8 percentage points versus the pre-ruling IEEPA peak. While it’s good news for China, the news isn’t so good for Australia, as Australia’s effective US tariff rate on many of its exports is rising from a 10% baseline to 15%—a 50% relative increase under the new temporary global surcharge announced by President Trump. This latest bout of trade war uncertainty has not helped the bitcoin price Bitcoin is down 2.8% today at $65,734, having earlier dropped below $65k for the first time in two weeks. US stock futures show that the S&amp;P 500 share index is on track to drop by 0.55% when trading resumes in New York. The narrower Dow Jones Industrial Average index is being called down 0.45%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq futures contract is down 0.65%. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst Hargreaves Lansdown: Wall Street ended last week on a high after the Supreme Court struck down the Trump administration’s use of its preferred tariff powers, with investors quickly repricing the outlook for lower effective tariff rates. That optimism is fading somewhat this morning, however, with US futures pointing lower as the dust settles and investors strap back in for another wave of tariff uncertainty. Chinese commerce ministry is urging Washington to lift its tariffs, saying it is making a “full assessment” of the supreme court’s tariff ruling. The ministry argued that the US unilateral tariffs are not in the interests of any party, adding: “There are no winners in a trade war and…protectionism leads nowhere.” Donald Trump’s new 15% flat-rate tariff is a boost for China, India and Brazil, according to analysis from Global Trade Alert, a trade monitoring body. Global Trade Alert have calculated that the shift away from the tariff regime before the supreme court ruling produces “clear winners and losers” among the top 20 exporters to the US. They explain: Countries that faced steep IEEPA surcharges see large tariff reductions: Brazil (-13.6 pp), China (-7.1 pp), and India (-5.6 pp) benefit most, since the flat S122 surcharge replaces country-specific IEEPA rates that were far higher. [S122 refers to section 122 of the US Trade Act of 1974, the legislation Trump is using for his new 15% tariffs]. The US Customs and Border Protection agency said it will halt collections of tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act at 12:01 a.m. EST (0501 GMT) on Tuesday, after the supreme court declared them illegal on Friday. CBP has told shippers through a message on its Cargo Systems Messaging Service that it will de-activate all tariff codes associated with President Donald Trump’s prior IEEPA-related orders as of Tuesday. With the dollar selling off, the pound has gained almost half a cent to $1.3523. The euro’s up a similar amount, to $1.1822. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. We’re in a new phase of trade war uncertainty, after the supreme court blocked Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs last Friday. With the president hitting back over the weekend, announcing a new temporary global tariff of 10%, then 15%, its clear that the White House is persisting with its policy of using trade levies to gain leverage over other countries. So, as ING economists warn: Announcements since the Supreme Court’s ruling strongly confirm that Trump has no intention of removing his “most beautiful word” from the English dictionary. Uncertainty is back, and given the latest muscle-flexing by European leaders, the risk of escalation is now higher than it was a year ago. The market reaction has been to sell the US dollar – it has fallen by 0.4% against a basket of other currencies today, adding to losses on Friday after the supreme court declared tariffs imposed under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to be illegal. US stock market futures are lower too, indicating we’ll see losses on Wall Street, while bitcoin has also weakened. Last night, US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer insisted that deals made with other countries are still intact, and should be honoured. Greer told CBS’s Face the Nation: “We want them to understand these deals are going to be good deals. “We’re going to stand by them. We expect our partners to stand by them.” Greer also pledged that the new 15% global tariff was distinct from the bilateral agreements struck in the last nine months with about 20 countries. That indicates that the deal announced by Trump and the UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in May last year will continue to stand, rather than the UK’s tariff rising to 15%. Although, as education secretary, Bridget Phillipson admitted on Sunday, UK businesses faced “uncertainty” after the latest developments.

2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:08Z,Drives me crazy: Mumbai residents plead for respite from ‘musical road’ ,"Residents of one of India’s most upmarket neighbourhoods say the country’s first “musical road” has turned their daily lives into a nightmare soundtrack. A stretch of Mumbai’s recently opened Coastal Road seafront expressway has been engineered to play the pulsating Oscar-winning tune Jai Ho from the movie Slumdog Millionaire when vehicles drive on it at lower speeds. Civic officials say the feature is intended to encourage safer driving and is the first of its kind in India. Most musical roads worldwide have been built in less populated areas, but Mumbai’s runs past Breach Candy, home to industrialists, Bollywood stars and other high-profile celebrities. Residents say the refrain of Jai Ho, which roughly translates from Hindi as “let there be victory”, plays repeatedly from 6am until midnight. More than 650 families have signed a formal complaint urging authorities to stop the music, describing it as constant “intrusive background noise” that has caused significant distress. The tune “enters homes”, the complaint says, and many households keep their windows shut to block it out. Japan pioneered the concept of a musical road in 2007, and they have since appeared in countries including Hungary, South Korea, the United Arab Emirates and the US. In Mumbai, India’s financial centre, civic officials pitched the project as a blend of engineering and entertainment and, most importantly, as a safety measure. Engineers have carved grooves in the asphalt that act like a giant vinyl record. When vehicles pass over them at between 45 and 50mph (70 and 80km/h), vibrations produce the tune composed by the Indian musician AR Rahman. If they drive too fast, the vibrations become uncomfortable, motivating drivers to slow down. Signs alert motorists before the musical stretch, telling them the speed required to experience the tune. The 500-metre section was inaugurated on 11 February by the Maharashtra chief minister, Devendra Fadnavis, who described it as a “showcase of innovation”. Authorities have defended the feature as helping to keep drivers alert while reinforcing speed discipline, but resident do not agree. In their complaint to Mumbai’s municipal commissioner and copied to the Maharashtra chief minister’s office, they flag the “auditory distraction on a high-speed road” as a potential safety hazard. They also accuse the authorities of focusing on what they see as a speed-control gimmick while failing to address more urgent concerns, such as high-performance cars roaring along Coastal Road at breakneck speed. The music is not broadcast through loudspeakers, but residents say its repetitive nature makes it difficult to ignore. At a time when many cities are working to reduce noise pollution, Mumbai is moving in the opposite direction, they argue. The eight-lane Coastal Road has been controversial since it was first proposed in 2011. The $1.6bn project has cut the driving time between Marine Drive and Worli from 45 minutes to about 10. But critics say the taxpayer-funded motorway, built on land reclaimed from the Arabian Sea, mainly benefits wealthier car owners, while the rest of Mumbai’s 23 million residents have to rely on jam-packed buses and trains."
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:03Z,Winter Olympics briefing: the tooth fairy brings gold as USA end 46-year wait,"If the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics opening ceremony was a love letter to Italian heritage, the final day was a thunderous operatic finale, a crescendo of clashing sticks, soaring amplitude and the bittersweet tears of legends taking their final bows. As the sun dipped behind the peaks of the Dolomites for the last time this fortnight, the Olympic flame did not just flicker out – it was passed from the high-fashion streets of Milan to the ancient stones of Verona. The final day’s headline act was the men’s ice hockey final which the weight of a 46-year ghost. Pitting the United States against Canada, the contest fell exactly on the anniversary of the 1980 Miracle on Ice. There was no need for a miracle this time, just the surgical precision of Jack Hughes. After Matt Boldy opened the scoring in the first period, the game transformed into a goaltending masterclass by Connor Hellebuyck, who turned aside 40 Canadian shots in normal time. Canada, playing without the injured Sidney Crosby AKA Captain Canada, found an equaliser through Cale Makar late in the second, but the golden goal belonged to Hughes. In overtime, he slotted the puck home, securing a 2-1 victory and the first American men’s gold since Lake Placid. “Unbelievable game. Unreal game by our team,” said Hughes. “Just a ballsy, gutsy win. That’s American hockey right there. That’s a great Canadian team, but we’re USA, we’re so proud to be Americans. Tonight was all for our country.” Hughes, who plays for the New Jersey Devils in the NHL, lost his front teeth before scoring the overtime goal after taking a high stick to the mouth from Canada’s Sam Bennett. “My first thought was to draw the penalty,” Hughes said. “Actually, my first thought was, I looked down the ice and saw my teeth and I was like, here we go again. I’m just glad we got out of that pickle.” The ice at the curling stadium hosted a different kind of drama: the Swedish Circus. Anna Hasselborg’s rink, featuring three mothers who had all given birth during this Olympic cycle, defeated Switzerland 6-5 in a tactical nailbiter to win the women’s final. Hasselborg, now only the second woman to win two Olympic golds as a skip, managed to please her most important critic – her daughter – who told her before the Olympics that “it’s so boring when you don’t have a medal”. “I think they will also remember this week,” Hasselborg said of her children. “They understood there was something big happening … I’m so proud to be able to show them that anything is possible. “Becoming a mother, it’s not always easy to find that balance in motivation and that you want to have the fighting spirit because becoming a mom is so much more important than everything else,” Hasselborg said of herself and her teammates, the three of which became pregannt agter winning bronze Beijing 2022. “But we found it at the right time.” In the half-pipe at Livigno, the atmosphere was equally electric after China’s Eileen Gu defended her title with a score of 94.75, cementing her status as the most decorated freeskier in Olympic history with six career medals. The 22-year-old revealed after the final that she had learned of her grandmother’s passing just after winning gold. “She was a steamship,” Gu said. “This woman commanded life, and she grabbed it by the reins, and she made it into what she wanted it to be. She inspired me so much. The last time I saw her before I came to the Olympics. She was very sick, so I knew that this was a possibility. I didn’t probably say that I was going to win, but I did promise her that I was going to be brave. She’s been brave.” Sharing the podium was Great Britain’s Zoe Atkin, who matched her sister Izzy’s 2018 achievement by snagging bronze. Atkin flew, reaching a staggering 5.4m (18 ft) above the pipe – the highest amplitude of the day. The final medal table saw Norway once again reign supreme with 18 golds and 40 total medals, fuelled largely by Johannes Høsflot Klæbo, who achieved an unprecedented six-for-six gold medal sweep in cross-country skiing. The United States finished a strong second with 12 golds, while the hosts, Italy, celebrated a record-breaking home Games with 30 medals. As the competition wound down, it dawned that this was the last time we would see many of our favourites in elite competition. Kaori Sakamoto of Japan inspired a generation of figure skaters in her country, bowing out with a silver medal and the honour as the only women’s singles skater from her country to compete at three Games. Canada’s Mikaël Kingsbury bowed out in style with gold in the freestyle skiing dual moguls, clinching a second career Olympic gold. Jessie Diggins retires as the most decorated American cross-country skier ever. And a trailblazer for Great Britain at the Games, the Alpine skier Dave Ryding said of his decision to step away: “I’m ready for the change. I honestly think the next 15 years of British skiing are taken care of. It will only get more and more exciting.” The Games concluded in the 2,000-year-old Roman amphitheatre in Verona with a closing ceremony that celebrated Italian opera and payed tribute to contemporary Italian classics. The Unesco site hosted a spectacle of dance and LED lights _ replacing traditional fireworks to protect local wildlife. The Italian singer Achille Lauro and ballet star Roberto Bolle bridged the gap between the antique and the avant garde, while the Olympic flag was handed over to the mayor of Nice for 2030.

2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:03Z,Mercedes magic and Ferrari’s rapid starts: what we learned from F1 testing,"Mercedes on the march The big four – Mercedes, Red Bull, Ferrari and McLaren – have been at pains throughout testing to claim they are not the top dog, in something of an inverse Mexican standoff, each decrying their own strengths. Undeniably, however, Mercedes emerge from the three pre-season tests looking strong. Mercedes’ car and engine were reliable, completing the most laps of any team. Perhaps most importantly the car looks balanced and easy to handle, planted through the corners, in stark contrast to their travails of recent years. It is performing just as the simulation data predicted, so George Russell has been purring. The pecking order among the top four is still somewhat opaque and will remain so until qualifying in Melbourne, but if Mercedes have been sandbagging – and they have yet to run on low fuel and soft tyres – then their real pace is going to be formidable. Ferrari fire from the blocks With such a wide-ranging regulation change, nothing is quite cut and dried. Red Bull have shown efficient energy recovery architecture, enabling them to deploy more electrical power for longer to deliver a straight-line speed advantage. Ferrari have the capacity to make blisteringly fast starts. A smaller turbocharger spins up to speed at starts. Such were the concerns over slow-starting cars, the FIA trialled a new launch procedure during testing. A five-second hold allows the cars at the back of the grid to bring their revs and turbo up to speed. When trialled, the Ferrari was revelatory, even more than their eye-catching rotating rear wing. When Lewis Hamilton applied the power it punched him forward like a rocket, from the fifth row to leading into turn one. It was no fluke. Esteban Ocon in the Ferrari-powered Haas made a similarly striking rapid getaway, and the pattern was established. Better still in a start procedure that is now complex and requires careful management, the Ferrari-engined cars have enjoyed predictable and straightforward launches, suggesting they have the sweet spot when the lights go out. And not suffering from so much turbo-lag, they can enjoy a similarly feisty punch on corner exit. Rule row still running How the new regulations will affect the racing, particularly the fears that energy management will play too prominent a role, have swirled around the paddock since the first simulations of the new cars were run last year. Over testing, the drivers’ fears escalated, with Max Verstappen outspoken in how much he disliked the new cars. Stefano Domenicali, the F1 chief executive, has called for calm before the first race but considerable disquiet remains. The drivers will doubtless adapt to the energy management requirements, including having to lift and coast and having their pace dictated by the need to harvest energy across a lap. But the acid test in Melbourne will be whether it affects the racing. If the changes have no broad effect on pace, the furore outside driver chuntering will probably fade swiftly. However, if it does prove to be a real issue, then action could be taken by the FIA and F1 to head off a painful start to the new setup. Aston Martin under the cosh If Adrian Newey is to work his magic for Aston Martin, the designer has his work cut out. The team who had been looking to 2026 with huge optimism, given the arrival of the most gifted car designer of his generation, the factory and wind tunnel all in place, have endured a nightmare in testing. They have completed only 128 laps this week, the fewest of any team by some distance. Newey’s ambitious aerodynamic aims may yet come good but not while basic issues with the gearbox and transmission have stymied running. Ominously, Aston Martin had to limit their run time on the final day of testing because engine manufacturer Honda had burned through so many parts they had a shortage. Honda’s trepidations about their readiness were clear when they launched their engine. “We need more power, simple as that, we’re just lacking on power and then we also need to improve the car, so a combination of things,” was a long-faced Lance Stroll’s assessment. While Fernando Alonso, who must be experiencing deja vu with another recalcitrant Honda engine, noted with no little understatement: “There are many things we need to fix.” Cadillac make it to the party Built from scratch in little over 12 months, F1’s newest team acquitted themselves well in testing. To have the car rolling across all three tests was an achievement in itself, given that Williams were not ready for Barcelona. Cadillac were not only running but putting some impressive miles on the clock. For a startup, there are no illusions at the team who expect to be bringing up the rear of the grid, but are in it for the long haul. Efforts have been made to manage expectations and the target for the moment is bringing both cars to the flag. Then perhaps to take a first point and demonstrate improvement across the season. Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Pérez spoke encouragingly of the car’s balance and while the hard yards remain ahead, Cadillac have started on the front foot. Tight midfield fight Behind the big four, the pecking order is similarly tight. Haas have made the greatest step up under the new regulations, and might be the best placed in midfield given the benefits of having a Ferrari engine. An improving Alpine have made their most positive start for some time. Williams are struggling after missing the Barcelona test and clearly have some way to go but there was optimism that they are on the right path. Racing Bulls have enjoyed the impressive debut for the Red Bull engine and should have the edge on Williams, as might Audi on their debut, certainly in the early phase of the season."
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:02Z,England’s zombies have rapidly descended into collective brain fog in Six Nations | Robert Kitson,"The band on the stadium concourse were playing a familiar tune in the immediate aftermath of England’s latest debacle on Saturday. “Zombie! Zombie!” the vocalist sang, ostensibly in tribute to Ireland’s record 42-21 victory at Twickenham. Alternatively he might just have been riffing on the horribly listless, blank-eyed performance that ended England’s Six Nations title hopes for another year. “In your he-ad, in your he-ad…” The old Cranberries anthem, synonymous with Ireland’s 2023 World Cup campaign in France, will be heard a few more times over the next month if Andy Farrell’s team maintain their revitalised excellence and no-nonsense physical intent. For England’s players, though, the past two weekends have been truly grim, a return to the bad old days they had dared to hope were over. Alas, dear reader, we may also have given the impression in these pages before the tournament that England were on the rise. Twelve wins on the spin had certainly encouraged the notion that Steve Borthwick’s side were gaining momentum, even if France were still well ahead of them. Sobering defeats for Ireland, Scotland and Wales on the opening weekend further stoked that breathless narrative. All of which – ahem – now feels a long, long time ago. At least it has been a timely reminder of how dramatically things can turn if a team are slightly off it or start assuming they have cracked this rugby lark. Or when their opponents opt not to dance to England’s preferred tune. As Scotland and now Ireland have underlined, yesterday’s crowing rooster can rapidly become tomorrow’s feather duster. All of which clearly paves the way for England to burst spectacularly into life, thrash both Italy and France away from home and remind their critics they were never too far away. In that event we can formally declare this the most perverse championship of the modern era and throw the trusty old crystal ball into the River Seine on the way home. But what if that doesn’t happen? What if the evidence of everyone else’s eyes is not remotely deceiving? Because Italy are arguably slight favourites to beat England in Rome in a fortnight given the visitors have just produced their poorest pair of Six Nations performances in years. And, for that reason alone, the foundations of Borthwick’s England project are inevitably back under scrutiny. It is fair to say that two weeks ago the management didn’t see this vertical descent coming. Nobody did. But it is now reasonable to ask how and why a team capable of whacking the All Blacks for six in November are now struggling to get the ball off the square. For whatever reason, the key areas England thought they had addressed – leadership, bench impact, aerial dominance, forward turbo thrust and backline rhythm – have all simultaneously gone awol again. If it were merely a case of a couple of fumbles close to the line, it would be an easy fix. Keep the faith, hopefully they’ll stick next time. But in successive games now England have seemed worryingly unable to see the tactical wood for the trees. Their rigid gameplan is based squarely around control; when that is not forthcoming they look horribly brittle. Their narrow defence is positively encouraging teams to attack them in the wider channels and their minds appear cluttered. What other overarching reason can there be – Irish pressure aside – for their disintegrating lineout, their vastly experienced fly‑half being unable to punt a penalty a few metres into the corner, the regression of their kicking game and, for good measure, another brace of yellow cards? The fireworks that greeted Maro Itoje’s 100th Test appearance for England made the skies over Twickenham pretty murky, but nothing compared with the collective brain fog that followed. When good players start displaying the consistency of headless chickens it is generally because they feel confused. And their defence is visibly suffering as a result: England have conceded 73 points and nine tries in only two games. The other giveaway is the conversion rate in the opposition 22. Ireland made nine entries with an average return of 4.3 points each; England made 12 visits that delivered only 1.7 points apiece on average. The bigger picture is similarly uncomfortable. In the past 23 years since the 2003 World Cup triumph, guess how many grand slams England have won? One is the answer – which, for an organisation with the Rugby Football Union’s mega resources, is a disgrace. The Prem elite have also been stubbornly prioritised at the expense of building a stable, virtuous club pyramid and, seemingly, the fostering of more young players capable of thinking for themselves. And, ultimately, there also remains a shortage of clear‑eyed vision and razor-sharp decision‑making within English rugby. Look at Farrell or Shaun Edwards and then ask what really matters in international rugby: is it social media vibes, technocrat waffle and more DJs at half-time? Or is it inspiring man-management and an innate understanding of how best to win the biggest games? England are great at analysing footage in retrospect, rather less so at reacting smartly in real time à la Ireland’s scrum-half Jamison Gibson-Park. The excellent Stuart McCloskey, Rob Baloucoune and Caelan Doris would also presently walk into the England team, and significant changes appear inevitable for Italy. But if their main men are either knackered, out of form or past it, an instantaneous revival becomes even trickier. And what’s that coming over the hill? Why, the Springboks in Johannesburg in July. Between now and then England’s “zombies” need to wake up fast."
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:01Z,‘I paid people with pints and chips’: Georgina Duncan on the prize-winning play she tapped out on her phone,"It took Georgina Duncan a few seconds to realise that Indhu Rubasingham, when announcing the winner of the Women’s prize for playwriting last week, was talking about her drama, Sapling. The 30-year-old recalls the moment: “The first sentence I heard her say, I was like, ‘That could be any of the plays.’ Then I was like, ‘Holy shit! This is the maddest thing that’s ever happened to me.’” The news still hasn’t fully sunk in, but anyone who has read Sapling will not be surprised by Duncan’s victory. Set in Belfast in the 1990s, the play follows 16-year-old Gerry, whose older brother Connor was murdered 10 years earlier by another child. “Someone described it as being about the scar tissue behind grief, which I thought was so eloquent,” Duncan says. The play was born out of her own fear of loss: “Grief is something we all experience in our lives. And it frightens me.” Duncan admits she didn’t know much about the Troubles before she began writing Sapling but , determined to make the play “right”, she took prison tours in Belfast, and rode in the back of a black cab with a driver named Cedric to absorb the city’s history and geography, while also meeting Northern Irish actors to talk through her ideas. “I paid them with a pint and a bowl of chips.” Her dedication paid off: Sapling rigorously paints a detailed picture of a scarred community. Even just on the page, there is an aliveness to her words, and she writes the kind of characters actors will be eager to play. This makes sense as Duncan is a trained actor, too. She graduated from the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art in 2018 and went on to star in The Mousetrap, the Agatha Christie West End staple and world’s longest-running play. Her time performing, she says, informs every piece of her writing: “When I write, I do speak my play aloud like a madman. Because I’ve said words in front of a live audience, I know what that feels like.” Storytelling, it becomes clear, runs through Duncan’s veins. She speaks fondly of her childhood in Lancashire, where she’d dance around her living room to Riverdance or watch Kate Bush videos on repeat. “Her music videos are theatre,” she says. “I’d watch them on loop.” Although her mother and father had no background in the arts, they encouraged her to follow her dreams. “I had working-class parents, they’re not from this world at all. We were quite skint, but they did everything they could to help me.” Applying for drama school became Duncan’s obsession as a teen. “I totally had the blinkers on,” she says. Writing came later, in the years after she graduated, when she had quit acting for a while. “I remember ringing my mum and saying, ‘I think I want to write.’ And she said, ‘Well, just do it.’” Duncan joined Soho theatre’s Writers’ Lab, where the origins of Sapling were formed. “I wrote most of the play on my phone on my commute,” she says. “I’ve stayed on tubes way longer than I should have because I got into a flow state.” In the years since, she wrote another play (“still in a drawer”) and a one-woman show called Asbo Bozo, about a social worker in Wigan. She performed it in London last year: “People seemed to be very moved.” Still, it has taken Duncan a long time to feel successful. Sapling was “shopped around”, with several versions of the script being entered for lots of prizes. “It got close a couple of times,” she says. “It was like the nearly man. The industry is so tough for people starting out, especially for people emerging with no context or anyone in the industry to open doors.” Which is why Duncan thinks awards like the Women’s prize – which was founded by producer and writer Ellie Keel, alongside Katie Posner and Charlotte Bennett of touring company Paines Plough – are so important. “Prizes are one of the few things we’ve got that are sort of a level playing field,” Duncan says. Keel, frustrated by the lack of plays by women produced on national stages, pitched a prize for female playwrights in 2019. It certainly feels essential: in its 50-year history, the Olivier award for best new play has only been won by a woman seven times. For Duncan, this feels like the start of something. With the £20,000 prize to support her, she hopes to be able to dedicate time to “really understand how” she writes. “It is the greatest gift. This prize has completely changed my life.” Now, for the first time, Duncan feels confident enough to call herself a playwright. “I feel,” she says, “like I’ve been legitimised.”"
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:01Z,Premier League: 10 talking points from the weekend’s action,"Tottenham in danger after drubbing Tottenham weren’t quite as dreadful as they were in losing 4-1 to Arsenal in November, but they were still extremely so, devoid of wit, energy, solidity, creativity, quality, and everything else one would hope to see in a football team. Make no mistake, they are in serious danger of going down and, assessing their fixtures, it is not easy to see where they might win enough points to stay up – all the more so given the form of West Ham and Nottingham Forest who are both playing well. Spurs, on the other hand, haven’t won a league game in 2026 and look like they’ve forgotten how – partly, it must be said, because of an awful injury list. So, where does Igor Tudor go from here? It may well be that his only option is to pick both Dominic Solanke and Randal Kolo Muani, get balls into the box, and hope they can make enough of them to save him – which might not be The Tottenham WayTM, but is a lot better than relegation. Daniel Harris • Match report: Tottenham 1-4 Arsenal Liverpool’s changing of the guard? Not for the first time this season, Mohamed Salah was largely anonymous in a Liverpool shirt. In fact, while he set up a rare effort on goal for Curtis Jones, it was the Egyptian’s withdrawal that triggered Liverpool’s late show. The 17-year-old Rio Ngumoha, Salah’s replacement, finally gave Neco Williams, who muted Salah, something to think about. Would it be over-egging it to suggest it was a sub that represented a changing of the guard? Ngumoha’s cross led to Alexis Mac Allister’s disallowed goal before the Argentinian struck a 97th-minute winner. It was another fine cameo for the Liverpool teenager, who joined from Chelsea at 15, and another sobering afternoon for Salah. “He has incredible potential, otherwise, at 17, you don’t play as many minutes as he does in the Premier League, let alone at Liverpool,” said the Liverpool manager, Arne Slot. “That tells you how much of a talent he is and we think he is. He is making progress more and more and that’s why you see him playing more and more.” Ben Fisher • Match report: Nottingham Forest 0-1 Liverpool Arokodare offers promise despite miss Rob Edwards was left to rue Tolu Arokodare’s missed penalty against Crystal Palace as Wolves went down to Evann Guessand’s late winner. The Nigeria striker scored 20 goals for Genk in Belgium last season but has struggled to settle at Molineux since arriving for £23m. He caused Crystal Palace plenty of problems at Selhurst Park and looks like the kind of striker who could thrive in the Championship if he is still around next season, even if his spot-kick technique needs to be improved. “I’m never going to come out and criticise him for missing a penalty,” said Edwards. “Tolu’s our number nine and felt positive over the ball. In that moment, it’s important you don’t change. There can be a number of people who want to take it, but Tolu was designated and wanted to take it at that time.” Ed Aarons • Match report: Crystal Palace 1-0 Wolves Sunderland have missed Xhaka Marco Silva says Raúl Jiménez has a “killer instinct” and adds that it is something “that should be enjoyed by everyone, whether they are Fulham fans or not.” Sunderland supporters might disagree with the Portuguese following the Mexican’s two goals – a header and a penalty – during their side’s 3-1 defeat. Jiménez certainly succeeded in silencing the Stadium of Light where a previously unbeaten Sunderland have now lost their last two Premier League games. With only two wins in their last 12 League fixtures, impending matches against Bournemouth, Leeds, Brighton and Newcastle have assumed additional importance for a team who will surely benefit from Granit Xhaka’s return to midfield. “We won’t give up,” said the ever calm Régis Le Bris, whose team have slipped to 12th. “We’ll find a way to change the situation. We need to find a way to better express our quality with the ball.” Louise Taylor • Match report: Sunderland 1-3 Fulham Haaland is more than a goal machine Erling Haaland did not score but a pinpoint cross that created Nico O’Reilly’s opener was his seventh assist in the Premier League (only Bruno Fernandes has more). Manchester City’s No 9 has also made vital defensive interventions and manager Pep Guardiola is impressed. “The numbers are unbelievable,” praised the Spaniard. “I’m really pleased. Sometimes I’m a critic of him, but today I said: ‘guy, without you winning would not be possible.’ I prefer him to not defend but he helps us, and after his teammates hug and celebrate with him and say they’re grateful. So Erling has been outstanding today.” Jamie Jackson • Match report: Manchester City 2-1 Newcastle United Who will be Kane’s deputy? If Thomas Tuchel is wondering whether he will take a second No 9 to the World Cup to act as Harry Kane’s understudy, then he certainly had an eye on Villa Park on Saturday. Ollie Watkins and Dominic Calvert-Lewin started the match, slugging it out to show who could be more effective as a lone striker for England, should Kane be unavailable. The Aston Villa man struggled against Leeds’ defence and was unable to make the most of chances created. Calvert-Lewin was sharper, using his physicality and smart runs to cause problems, seemingly having the greater confidence of the two. Neither scored but one Englishman did, with Tammy Abraham coming off the bench to force a late equaliser for Villa. After years away from the Premier League, he will want to remind everyone of qualities. Abraham has thrown his hat into the ring for a plane ticket to America but Calvert-Lewin currently looks the best bet. Will Unwin • Match report: Aston Villa 1-1 Leeds United Eze keeps defenders guessing Watching his team this season, it’s often looked like Mikel Arteta simply has no clue what to do with Eberechi Eze, a maverick improvisor who can’t be pinned down to a profile or position – or, in other words, he is the exact opposite of what this Arsenal side represent. But perhaps the disappointments of the last few weeks have forced Arteta’s hand, and he is finally ready to trust a player who, though far from perfect, brings the imagination and variety so painfully missing in his absence. Opponents fear Eze – in a way they do not Leandro Trossard, Martin Ødegaard, Gabriel Martinelli and Noni Madueke – because he can drive forward with the ball through the middle of the pitch and, unlike his rivals for selection, he is also able to play the game at his own tempo, delving into a deep bag of feints and tricks to produce moments that surprise defenders. It is time for Arteta to forsake his natural caution and let his one true artist work. Daniel Harris Chelsea press self-destruct button Poor discipline is costing Chelsea. Against Burnley, Wesley Fofana’s crunching challenge on James Ward-Prowse was a second yellow-card offence and the Blues duly dropped two points. There was a case for a straight red but it still added up to an eighth dismissal of the season for Chelsea. Only West Ham, with nine in 2015-16, have collected more over a Premier League campaign, and there are still 11 games to play. A prolific collection of yellow cards also places Chelsea rock bottom in the fair-play standings. Ill-discipline extends to concentration, and an unmarked Zian Flemming headed in Burnley’s equaliser, meaning Chelsea have now dropped 17 points from winning positions at Stamford Bridge. A second successive home draw to follow the 2-2 draw against Leeds exasperated Liam Rosenior. “I will never, ever speak about what’s happened before me,” he said, referring to an issue inherited from Enzo Maresca. “What has happened with me is we have set fire to four points from two home games.” John Brewin • Match report: Chelsea 1-1 Burnley West Ham finally show a bit of grit A failure to put away even one of their 20 shots in the goalless draw with Bournemouth left West Ham ruing a missed opportunity but the Londoners had a collective desire and unity evident in recent weeks that had been sorely lacking. “We have to fight our way out of it,” Jarrod Bowen said of the Hammers’ survival fight. “Not talking about quality, talking about characters and people that will grab each other by the scruff of the neck when we need to. That’s a pleasing thing in the changing room when you can look around and say: ‘He’s got my back and I’ve got his.’” Andoni Iraola admitted his Bournemouth side could not cope with West Ham’s intensity from kick-off. The hosts are finally playing like a team fighting for their Premier League lives and two clean sheets in three games tells a story, as does just one defeat in six league games. Things are about to get tougher, though, with Liverpool, Man City and Aston Villa among their next four games. A lack of quality may ultimately cost West Ham, but character no longer should. Ben Bloom • Match report: West Ham 0-0 Bournemouth Hürzeler should be given time After six league games without a win – a period that also featured a comprehensive FA Cup defeat to Liverpool – Fabian Hürzeler badly needed the win Brighton brought back from Brentford. Football being football, it is no surprise that the 32-year-old is under pressure. For those older than Hürzeler that are judging the German, it is useful to reflect on how little we knew at that point in our lives, especially as the majority of us did or don’t work in an environment as intense and pressurised as managing in the Premier League. Learning the job while also learning about himself and in charge of a squad that include members that are older than him, Hürzeler has adapted his game-model to the constantly evolving requirements of a ludicrously competitive division. This is a fiendishly difficult activity – and progress is rarely linear – and Hürzeler has shown more than enough to be given time to develop and grow.

2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:01Z,Winter Olympics offer little fame or fortune but athletes and stories make them great | Andy Bull,"It was the Olympics of politics and penises, of JD Vance being jeered and of Ukrainian bobsledders being banned from the competition, of a convicted criminal beating the teammate she was guilty of defrauding, of Lindsey Vonn crashing out 12 seconds into the race and of Ilia Malinin making one mistake too many, of the internet became momentarily obsessed with slow‑motion videos of a Canadian stroking a curling stone with the tip of his finger, and it was the Olympics where the Norwegian ski‑jump team refused to dignify questions about whether or not they were injecting acid into their genitals. Like I said right at the beginning, Pierre de Coubertin never wanted a Winter Olympics. If that line sounds a little familiar it might be because you read it here a fortnight or so ago. “The great inferiority of these snow sports is that they are completely useless,” Coubertin wrote, “with no useful application whatsoever.” But it’s true, too, that over time he changed his mind. And by the end of the International Olympic Committee’s very first Olympic “winter sports week” at Chamonix in 1924 he gave a speech in which he told his audience that “winter sports are among the purest”. You had to hold both these ideas in your mind at the same time at Milan-Cortina. By and large the Winter Olympic sports are, yes, “completely useless”. Unless you live in one of the handful of countries in the world where one or another of these pastimes actually counts in popular culture, the way speed skating does in the Netherlands, or cross-country skiing does in Norway, or ice hockey does in Canada, they’re not going to inspire mass participation. A decade from now, no one except a handful of future competitors will ever say they grew fitter, stronger, or more sporty, because they took place. And it is exactly that uselessness that makes them what they are. Pure is the word Coubertin used. Inspiring is the one the Instagram generation would choose. Nobody is here because they’re going to get rich from competing, nobody comes with the aim of getting famous, a lot of the competitors don’t even hope to win a medal, and some of the ones who do know better than anyone that the biggest single advantage they have is the amount of money their country has decided to invest in their training, often in events where, in all honesty, there’s just not that much elite competition. So why are they here? The answer is the same one that humans have always had in the mountains, the same one George Mallory gave when they asked him why he wanted to climb Everest: “Because it’s there.” They come to test themselves. As the rest of us get to watch. You don’t need to want to ski downhill to be struck dumb by the bravery of Lindsey Vonn’s decision to try to race the Olimpia di Tofane with a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament. You don’t need to want to ride skeleton to admire Matt Weston’s relentless perfectionism. You don’t need to know how to cross-country ski to find something to love in Johannes Høsflot Klæbo’s bloody-minded determination to overcome every single obstacle in front of him across two weeks of competition. You don’t need to be able to slalom to experience the joy at watching Mikaela Shiffrin overcome her PTSD 16 months after she nearly died in a crash, or be astounded by the speed and grace of Federica Brignone 11 months after she broke her leg so badly that she wasn’t sure she would ever be able to walk normally. You don’t need to be able to tell a run-back takeout from a hit-and-run to feel regret at just how much it hurt Bruce Mouat, Hammy McMillan, Bobby Lammie and Grant Hardie, to win a silver medal in the men’s curling when they had spent four years dreaming about the gold. And at the end of it all, it is still OK to ask whether the price paid was worth it. These Olympics, like almost every Olympics, have run grotesquely over budget. Athletes always talk about the jeopardy of winter sports, but there has been an abiding sense of uncertainty about these entire Games. A hell of a lot of effort went into making sure they looked good on TV, but on the ground it’s hard to avoid the sense that Italy only just got away with it. They left everything so late that well over 50% of the budgeted construction work on roads, rails, and car parks won’t even be finished until long after they’re over and everyone has gone home. The latest on the slate isn’t due to be finished till 2033. There is a lesson here too, about accepting imperfection, not that anyone at the IOC will learn it. Because even though these Olympics were half-finished, they worked fine. The Games don’t always need to be more than the one before. There was no need to carve a new snow park into the mountains at Livigno when there was one in the next valley over, no need to cut down a forest to build a new sliding track in Cortina when there’s one 60 miles away in Innsbruck, no need to erect new, bigger, ski jumps when there’s a smaller one already next door. The Olympic creed is Faster, Higher, Stronger, but the IOC’s sometimes seems like Better, Bigger, Richer. Because it’s the athletes who make them great. Give them ice, and they will race; give them mountains, and they will throw themselves down them. All the rest is just set dressing."
2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:01Z,I am a 15-year-old girl. Let me show you the vile misogyny that confronts me on social media every day | Anonymous,"If you’re anything like my parents, you probably wouldn’t even understand most of the content that floods my social media, no matter how hard I try to avoid it. Here’s a recent example from Instagram: “Do y’all females ever tell ur homegirls ‘Sis chill you letting too many dudes hit?’” Essentially, that means: “Women – do you ever tell your girlfriends that they’re whores and need to stop letting so many guys fuck them?” The reel, posted by a 19-year-old man, appeared on my Instagram feed without me wanting to see it, or ever interacting with any other similar content. The comments that followed were pure misogyny. “Women see body count as a leaderboard and they try to outdo each other,” was one of them. Translation: all women are competitively promiscuous. Consider the use of the word “female” in these posts. It is not a neutral term here, it is a term of abuse. It’s used by teenage boys to degrade us and equate us to animals. Boys are never described as “males”, but girls are always “females” – the equivalent of sows or calves, creatures that are less than human. We’re also “thots” (whores), “community pussy” and “bops”. “Bop” stands for “been over passed” and is a derogatory term used by boys to refer to a girl they’ve decided has been “passed around” or had too much sex. Sexual equality has ceased to exist online. It’s absolutely fine for boys to have sex, but when girls do, they are called worthless and referred to as objects. “When community pussy tries to insult me, I just want to beat that bitch up.” That’s a message I saw on TikTok. I’m a 15-year-old schoolgirl and like most teenagers I spend a fair portion of my spare time on social media, often scrolling through short-form videos on apps such as Instagram or TikTok. All of my friends use those apps, and many spend multiple hours a day on them. I actively try to avoid online misogyny, but I am met with it incessantly whenever I open my mainstream social media apps. It only takes a few minutes before there’s subtle or overt misogyny, such as comment sections on a girl’s post filled with remarks about her body, videos made by men or boys captioned with a degrading joke, and even topics such as domestic violence or rape, trivialised and laughed about. A few days ago I saw an Instagram reel of a young woman talking about how she had been raped six years ago, struggled with thoughts of suicide afterwards, but managed to rebuild her life again. Among the comments – the majority of which were from men – were things like “Well at least you had some”, “No way, she’s unrapeable”, “Hope you didn’t talk this much when it happened”, “Bro could have picked a better option.” Reading those comments, which had thousands of likes and many boys agreeing with them, made me feel sick. If a girl my age posts any video of herself online, the comments section will be filled with objectifying and hateful remarks about her, regardless of what the topic of her post was. If she wears anything revealing, or just happens to have larger breasts, she’ll be abused and sexualised. Completely unprompted, there might be hundreds of comments insulting specific features she may have, or rating her attractiveness out of 10. “Sub5”, for example, describes someone who is below 5/10 in attractiveness. I’ve seen videos of boys telling anyone who is unattractive that they should end their own life. Despite the sexual ways in which boys my own age describe us online, there is also an extreme emphasis on female purity and virginity. Sex is often called as “cracking” by my age group, where men do the cracking and women get cracked. “Body count” – referring to the number of times someone has had sex – is used only to degrade women. A girl with a “high body count” is “used up” and no longer has value. “You can always tell if she’s ran through,” one boy said on Instagram. Often it feels like we’re hated not only if we’re sexual but simply for existing. I would be lying if I said I wasn’t affected by seeing boys my own age post things about women like: “Men are objectively superior in pretty much every conceivable metric,” and “They are just devils that imitate feelings so we feel empathy.” Words such as “bitch” are the least of it. One of the worst labels is “foid” – originally from incel subculture but now becoming mainstream – which refers to women as being less-than-human, female humanoids. And what is the effect? If I spend even 10 minutes on an app such as Instagram, I will close it, feeling disheartened and unhappy about being a girl. When nearly every comments section on a video of a girl my age is filled with disgusting and objectifying comments about her body from boys, it causes me to feel deeply uncomfortable in my own body, and compare myself to her; especially if she is beautiful and still being deemed unattractive. Endless emphasis on beauty as worth and all kinds of videos criticising specific features, some of which I possess, have made me start to loathe my own face, as difficult as that is to admit. But the worst thing is knowing how much hate there is from men and boys for all women and girls, including me. Using social media has ruined my self-esteem and my relation to being a girl in this world, and nearly every day I feel hatred towards my gender, my appearance, or even teenage boys as a category. The misogyny I see from boys my age online, which is echoed in real life too, has made me grow resentful and bitter towards them, as much as I try to avoid it. As wrong as it is, I persistently find myself considering if there are truly any boys out there who are not misogynistic to some extent, and have even questioned whether I can find love in the future because of this. I understand that boys are victims of harmful content, as well as perpetrators of online misogyny – they’re growing up learning how to do this from the adults who post misogynistic videos first. But even so, I feel such a strong divide now between girls and boys in my generation, especially when the way they talk about us in real life mirrors the way they do on the internet. I can’t speak for every girl my age, but I frequently feel objectified, dehumanised and disgusted by the hate towards women I see online, and I can say with certainty that most of my friends would agree with me. A social media ban for under-16s might prevent young boys seeing endless content that treats women with contempt and hate. Boys at this age are very susceptible to the cool and funny framing of what is, in reality, relentless misogyny. A ban might not fix the problem, but it would help. If society can’t stop it, it can show it disapproves.

2026-02-23,2026-02-23T08:00:00Z,Is it true that … men need to consume more calories than women?,"‘Generally speaking, yes,” says Bethan Crouse, a performance nutritionist from Loughborough University, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all rule. Humans burn calories to fuel everything from movement to sleeping. For the general adult population aged from about 19 to 64, guidance puts daily energy needs at about 2,000 calories for women and 2,500 for men (the requirements are very different in children and adolescents, and tend to fall with age: they decline between 65 and 74, and drop again after 75). But averages hide a lot of variation. One of the main reasons men typically need more calories is that they usually have a higher resting (or basal) metabolic rate, meaning they burn more energy at rest. This is largely explained by differences in body composition – on average, men have more lean muscle mass, while women tend to have a higher proportion of body fat – and muscle burns more calories than fat. These differing levels of muscle mass aren’t because of what we eat or how we work out, they’re driven by hormones. Testosterone, which is present at higher levels in men, promotes muscle growth. This means that even if you compared a man and a woman of exactly the same height, age and weight, with the same exercise routine, their calorie needs may still differ. But, Crouse says, there’s individual variation. Take, for example, a muscular woman and a more average man. “That female probably needs more calories than the male at rest, and you can infer that the female is probably doing more exercise anyway, so that’s going to increase her need for calories too.” Long-term dieting can further complicate the picture. Extended periods of severe calorie restriction can reduce a person’s baseline energy requirements, in effect turning down the body’s “metabolic dial”. If you’re unsure how many calories you should be eating, says Crouse, the NHS and WebMD have helpful guides."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:35:18Z,Trump’s new global tariffs kick in at 10% – business live ,"European markets have opened a bit lower this morning, as investors digest the news of Trump’s latest 10% tariff. The UK’s blue chip FTSE 100 index has dropped 0.25%. In Italy the FTSE MIB has dropped 0.4%, the German Dax is down 0.2% and the French Cac 40 is down by 0.1%. The Stoxx Europe 600, which tracks the biggest listed companies across the continent, has slipped 0.2%. The worst performer in Europe so far is the UK-listed student accommodation provider Unite Group, with its shares falling by more than 8% this morning. The company told investors that it had sold fewer student beds last year, after a drop in demand from international applicants. William Bain, head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce, warns that while the 10% tariff is not as bad as threats of a 15% rate, the changing policies are making it harder for businesses to plan ahead. He says: It is far from clear what will happen next, and whether a higher tariff rate is still on the way. Despite the immediate reprieve, there is fresh uncertainty for UK firms exporting goods to the US. This makes it very difficult for firms to understand the prices and margins they will be able to secure for their goods, currently under production, for export in several months’ time. Inevitably this will have an impact on their sales and hit the economy. The BCC has provided government with a six-point plan to guard against the worst economic outcomes from the new tariffs and potential further hikes. This includes continued negotiation with the US government, engagement with the US Congress, an uplift in UK Export Finance capacity and reviewing the UK’s Global Tariffs. The risk of further tariff pain to come is still real and the government must do everything it can to prepare for the worst.” Not everyone was happy that Trump’s “reciprocal” tariffs were deemed illegal by the US supreme court last week. FedEx has sued the US government, seeking to receive reimbursement of their share of an estimated $175bn in levies after the highest court found Trump had overstepped his authority in issuing the tariffs. The FedEx lawsuit named as defendants US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), which collects tariffs; the agency’s commissioner Rodney Scott; and the United States of America. The suit was filed in the US court of international trade. The company did not specify an amount in its complaint but said it was seeking a “full refund” for duties paid to the US. The company said in a statement: While the supreme court did not address the issue of refunds, FedEx has taken necessary action to protect the company’s rights as an importer of record to seek duty refunds from US Customs and Border Protection. You can read the full story by my colleague Gabrielle Canon here: Trump’s new global 10% tariff is being applied under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, which allows the president to impose the charge for 150 days without congressional approval. The president has used this approach after the supreme court ruled that he had violated an emergency-powers law to enact his “reciprocal” tariffs on imported goods from countries around the world. The new tariffs do have some exemptions, including goods that were part of the North American trade pact between the US, Canada and Mexico. The order also includes an exception for some agricultural goods. It is not clear yet what the fallout will be. The UK has not ruled out retaliation, with a spokesperson for Keir Starmer saying yesterday that “nothing is off the table”, and the chair of the EU Parliament’s trade committee, Bernd Lange, said yesterday: We want to have clarity from the US that they are respecting the deal because that’s a crucial element.” Trump has warned that any country that wants to “play games” with the supreme court decision would be “be met with a much higher Tariff, and worse, than that which they just recently agreed to.” But Jim Reid, of Deutsche Bank, says it is unclear how the president might respond to developments in the UK and the EU. At the moment the rate is 10% with White House officials stating that they are working on a formal order to raise to 15%. Perhaps the stacking concern is delaying things for now. Late yesterday, we also saw the WSJ and Bloomberg report that the administration was preparing new Section 232 national security investigations into several industries including batteries, telecom equipment and industrial chemicals. Remember that Trump’s delivering the State of the Union address tonight, so it’s possible we might get a better sense of the next steps on tariffs…net-net we still think the effective tariff rate will fall this year and that the world post-SCOTUS will see lower tariffs than the pre-SCOTUS world. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. President Donald Trump’s new tariffs have come into effect today at a rate of 10%, after the US supreme court blocked many of his import taxes on Friday. The president signed an executive order last Friday authorising the 10% tariffs just hours after the supreme court ruling. He later threatened to raise the rate to 15%, but did not officially do so by Tuesday 12.01am time in Washington, when the 10% levy came into effect. However, Bloomberg is reporting that officials in the White House are working on a formal order that will increase the rate to 15%. It comes after Trump declared this week that he can use tariffs in a “much more powerful and obnoxious way”. The new tariffs, which Trump is applying under Section 122 of the 1974 Trade Act, have triggered uncertainty with a number of US trading partners, including the UK (which negotiated a 10% rate with the US last year) and the EU. On Monday the EU paused the process of ratification of the deal it had struck with the US last July for the second time in a month, after it froze and unfroze the deal in the wake of Trump’s Greenland threats. The deal was for 15% blanket tariffs on EU imports that were inclusive of previous levies. Meanwhile in the UK, a spokesperson for Keir Starmer, when asked whether retaliatory tariffs were an option, said: No one wants to see a trade war. No one wants to see a situation that’s escalated. But as I say, nothing is off the table at this stage.

2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:34:39Z,Australia v India: first women’s cricket one-day international – live,"The left-arm spinner was sensational at the World Cup, and Shree Charani strikes here! Tosses it up, Litchfield jumps out of her crease and launches a big straight drive, but is done in the air. The ball clips her pocket which slows it down, increasing the degree of difficulty for Ghosh who has to wait for that ball before double-fisting it into the stumps. Litchfield almost has time to get back, but not quite. 10th over: Australia 55-0 (Healy 18, Litchfield 32) A few leg byes in that over from Kashvee, Australia ticking along. 9th over: Australia 49-0 (Healy 15, Litchfield 31) Renuka wants to keep Healy pinned on strike, and will be frustrated that an inside edge squeezes away for a run. That allows Litchfield to open up the scoring, a lovely square drive that beats the fielder in the deep, then another brace that doesn’t. Australia a quarter of the way there in quick time. 8th over: Australia 42-0 (Healy 14, Litchfield 25) Kashvee Gautam replaces Kranti, similar right-arm seam, does better though: beats a wild drive from Litchfield on the outside edge, then nicks the inside edge past the stumps. It costs three runs but nearly got the wicket. 7th over: Australia 37-0 (Healy 12, Litchfield 22) Close review! Not a bad shout for India, Renuka Singh shaping the ball in, and with Richa Ghosh coming up to the stumps, Healy has to move her stance back into her crease. The ball hits her above the knee roll, but that’s less often a factor in women’s cricket where a lot of players are shorter, and Healy is certainly one of them. She’s given not out, though the projection shows it might have been taking both bails off. Umpire’s call. A few balls later, dropped catch. A very tough one for the keeper standing up. An inside edge that lets Healy steal a single, it smacks into Ghosh’s gloves but ricochets. No, scratch that, the umpire calls a bye. The only score from the over. 6th over: Australia 36-0 (Healy 12, Litchfield 22) The young Aussie opener keeps taking down the young Indian opening bowler. Sizing her up by now, belts one boundary with a pick-up shot over midwicket, then smacks another leg-side ball behind square. She’s 22 off 16, while Healy is starting more slowly, having faced 22 balls. 4th over: Australia 27-0 (Healy 12, Litchfield 13) Square punch from Litchfield for four! She has two catchers waiting behind point, but hits it along the paint and finds the rope, then gets a leg-side ball and picks it up behind square, four more as Kranti Gaud struggles for line. 5th over: Australia 27-0 (Healy 12, Litchfield 14) Very tidy over from Renuka Singh Thakur, just a Litchfield single off it. 3rd over: Australia 17-0 (Healy 11, Litchfield 4) Healy batting out of her crease to Renuka, looking to cut down swing, and a drive back has a touch of leading edge about it, not far from the bowler’s outstretched hand. Stopped at mid off, though. Then beats the outside edge with one that doesn’t swing, as Healy drives. Then another leading edge! This one goes about 160 degrees around the clock face, skewing through a vacant slip. Healy gets a couple, then lifts a clunky pull shot over square leg for one, just up and other to dink it away. Litchfield, starved of the strike, gallops down to what is only her fourth ball and slices the drive away over backward point for four. 2nd over: Australia 9-0 (Healy 8, Litchfield 0) Kranti Gaud stats well, aside from a leg-side wide to the left-hander. That’s after Healy takes four balls to get off strike, hard to score from a tight line around off stump. 1st over: Australia 7-0 (Healy 7, Litchfield 0) Gets going with a nice drive! Healy facing the bowling of Renuka Singh Thakur, who is getting a tiny bit of shape but an overpitched ball is driven just to the leg side of the other set of stumps, away for four. A two and a single follow. The major story today is that Alyssa Healy’s comes into the reckoning for her last series for Australia, having sat out the T20 component. She’ll have these three ODIs, then the Test, fitness permitting. Thank you, Jonathan PH. A very level man who is neither acidic or basic. That’s a pretty modest score for India to defend, 214. It’s also Victor Trumper’s highest Test score. Part of a satisfying little sequence, in fact. Start with 213, which is the score from the Egbaston tied semi-final in 1999, and Ellyse Perry’s Test best at North Sydney, then 214 for Trumper, 215 for Steve Smith at Lord’s, and 216 for Clarrie Grimmett’s career wicket tally. That’s your game of Nerd Pledge for the day, let’s watch some cricket. Four points to two down in the multi-format series, there is plenty of pressure on Australia despite the modest run-chase ahead of them. To see if they can even the ledger it’s over to Geoff Lemon. After winning the toss India will be disappointed to have only reached 214. At times throughout the afternoon even a total that modest looked improbable but some powerful late hitting from Kashvee Gautam has given the world champions something to defend The extra bounce of the Allan Border Field pitch did for a succession of Indian batters, many of whom were caught top-edging or leading-edging, especially from sweep shots. One such was Smriti Mandahana who top scored with 58. She was fortunate to reach double figures after edging the new ball repeatedly towards the slip cordon, bu once into her stride she looked set for a big score until she gifted Tahlia McGrath her only wicket of the day. McGrath was one of seven Australian bowlers called upon by Alyssa Healy, six of whom took wickets. Ash Gardner’s three was the most, but the damage was done early by the recalled Megan Schutt, and in the middle by the majestic Alana King. In case you missed it earlier, Australia are without both Ellyse Perry and Kim Garth for the ODI portion of this series due to quad injuries. Schutt was one of the players to seize their opportunity with a late call-up, Georgia Voll the other, taking three excellent catches in the outer. Hmmm, perhaps Gautam got caught up in the moment of stepping to leg and reflex hooking a Sutherland slower ball bouncer. She takes a single from the opening delivery of the over, inviting India’s No 11 to survive five deliveries. She survives two handily, but on the second the ball is hit straight to Gardner at mid-on. She spots Gautam miles out of her ground backing up and calmly underarms a direct hit to end the innings. 48th over: India 212-9 (Gautam 41, Renuka 0) What has Gautam got in these final throes? A massive six over cow corner is what! Bosh! Then she pilfers a couple of byes as she keeps control of the strike. A mistimed pull lands safely, giving Renuka just one ball to defend – which she does. India continue into the 49th over. 47th over: India 203-9 (Gautam 35, Renuka 0) Just two singles and the wicket from Schutt’s ninth over. Schutt does her thing and Charani slaps a lusty blow into the safe hands of Voll on the midwicket fence. Her catching has been a real highlight of the afternoon. 46th over: India 201-8 (Gautam 34, Charani 1) Charani, like Gaud before her, doesn’t seem interested in simply rotating strike to bring the set batter to the crease. Finally Gautam does gets back on strike and immediately slog-sweeps Gardner for four. Gaud’s grisly ten ball stay ends attempting another massive hoick, this time top-edging to Molineux at short third. Gardner has three. 45th over: India 196-7 (Gautam 30, Gaud 2) Healy persists with Schutt’s pace and she beats Gaud’s attempted slogs four times in a row with a mixture of pace, bounce, and cutters. Eventually India’s No 9 decides to play tip and run to bring Gautam on strike but there’s no communication… and Gaud may have run herself out in the process! She gets back close to her ground with time to spare, but instead of sliding her bat to safety she plants it bang on the line, saved only by her spikes following through shortly afterwards, but that was a review that required the third umpire to make a judgement call based on a frame that perhaps never existed. An over of awful batting ends with Gaud pinching strike! 44th over: India 195-7 (Gautam 30, Gaud 1) That’s the seventh time Gardner has snared Harmanpreet in international cricket and it will go a long way to stalling India’s momentum late in their innings. Voll’s catch improves with every replay. Healy returns to spin as India launch their late assault – and it proves an inspired decision! From her second legal delivery Gardner has Harmanpreet caught in the deep slog-sweeping. It is a magnificent catch, by the diving Voll on the midwicket rope. 43rd over: India 191-6 (Harmanpreet 53, Gautam 29) India are starting to look for more shots now, including Harmanpreet scooping Schutt for a couple and Gautam holding her form for a powerful straight six! That was a beautiful strike to bring up the 50 partnership from 56 balls. 42nd over: India 181-6 (Harmanpreet 50, Gautam 22) Sutherland’s changes of pace are superb, denying India any timing. Harmanpreet can only deal in singles, including the 36th of a grinding innings, to bring up her 50. 41st over: India 179-6 (Harmanpreet 49, Gautam 21) Megan Schutt returns for her second spell, fully 30 overs after she completed her brilliant first. There’s still plenty of movement on offer for the veteran, beating the set Harmanpreet with a wicked in-ducker. Then she’s unlucky a lusty swipe from the Indian skipper clips the outside edge and runs away for four down to third. 40th over: India 172-6 (Harmanpreet 44, Gautam 20) Sutherland continues to excel with her changes of pace, keeping India to just three singles. 39th over: India 167-6 (Harmanpreet 42, Gautam 17) Drop! McGrath makes an awful mess at mid-off as Gautam skews a lofted drive that pops in and out of the fielder’s hands. She was never set. King has to accept that her tremendously entertaining ten over spell ends with figures of one, not two, for 43. 38th over: India 164-6 (Harmanpreet 40, Gautam 16) Sutherland gets another chance, this time interrupting Molineux’s spell, presumably to avoid Gautam getting her eye in after her assault of the previous over. And she bowls a superb assortment of pace and off-pace to befuddle both batters and restore some control to proceedings. 37th over: India 162-6 (Harmanpreet 39, Gautam 15) India are going boundary crazy! Harmanpreet gets in on the act, profiting from a rare King full toss and dispatching it through midwicket. Gautam then misses a reverse sweep and the ball kicks off the pitch into her grille which prompts a brief concussion protocol intervention. 36th over: India 156-6 (Harmanpreet 34, Gautam 14) Gautam steps to leg and out of nowhere slaps Molineux over cow corner for the most unexpected six! She follows that up by another swept four well in front of square! Just as I was about to revisit Harmanpreet’s tactic of rotating the strike and accepting easy singles early in the over. 35th over: India 145-6 (Harmanpreet 33, Gautam 4) Sutherland is only afforded one over as King is recalled by Healy to spin out India’s tail. But neither bowler nor captain could have expected Kashvee Gautam to get off the mark with a faultless sweep hammered in front of square leg for four. A couple of near misses thereafter but an LBW shout was declined for pitching outside leg then the batter just avoided an outside edge as they hung their blade out to dry. 34th over: India 140-6 (Harmanpreet 32, Gautam 0) Molineux beats new batter Gautam in the air and off the pitch but she does well to anchor her back foot as Mooney whips off the bails in search of a stumping. The bowler is relentless though and the incoming skipper completes a wicket maiden. Australia have a sixth! It’s too straight to cut but Ghosh goes for the shot anyway, cutting the metronomic Molineux low to Voll at backward point. India’s No 7 lacked timing throughout her innings but departs with a handy 23. 33rd over: India 140-5 (Harmanpreet 32, Ghosh 23) Healy wants to see what pace will do after a passage of spin from both ends, and Sutherland is soon beating the outside edge of Ghosh’s bat and almost knocking the off bail to the floor. But the batter survives and gets exactly what she’s looking for shortly afterwards, a full delivery, in the slot, that she can loft over long-on for a very welcome boundary, the first in about eight overs. 32nd over: India 132-5 (Harmanpreet 30, Ghosh 17) It’s now 43 balls since India’s last boundary. They can’t get Molineux away despite Ghosh’s delicate late-cutting and lap-sweeping. 31st over: India 130-5 (Harmanpreet 30, Ghosh 15) King is landing her stock ball exactly where she wants, which isn’t great news for India. Ghosh does her best to swipe her way out of trouble and connects with a couple of scoring shots. 30th over: India 126-5 (Harmanpreet 29, Ghosh 12) Just a single from Molineux’s second over. India don’t know whether to stick or twist. Harmanpreet needs to take control of this innings before it gets away from her side. 29th over: India 125-5 (Harmanpreet 28, Ghosh 12) Another swing and a miss from Ghosh, then a spinny top-edge that lands just wide of the diving Brown at backward point. King is among the most watchable bowlers in the sport. 28th over: India 122-5 (Harmanpreet 26, Ghosh 11) McGrath is indeed withdrawn from the attack and it’s Molineux who replaces her – and she strikes after just two balls! Left-arm around the wicket, pitching on middle, straightening, beating Ghosh’s defensive push and earning the umpire’s raised index finger. The batter reviews, and is reprieved when ball tracking suggests the delivery was bouncing over the bails. Nonetheless Australia are well on top of this contest. India have lost all momentum since Mandhana’s dismissal. 27th over: India 119-5 (Harmanpreet 24, Ghosh 10) Speaking of weapons, King has a massive LBW shout against Ghosh declined onfield so Healy sends it upstairs. It’s a magnificent legspinner, drifting towards leg stump then spinning and bouncing fiercely back towards the top of off stump. DRS doesn’t take long, revealing the ball pitched fractionally outside leg stump because of all that drift. Ghosh responds by aiming a huge mow but she connects only with fresh air as King weaves her magic. Changing tack, Ghosh plays off the back foot but then almost guides slip-catching practice to Healy, earning a couple down to third for her troubles. Undaunted she slaps a couple through the covers to round off an enthralling over. 26th over: India 114-5 (Harmanpreet 24, Ghosh 6) Ghosh is going hard early and she almost mistimes a drive to the diving Lichfield in the covers. McGrath gets out of an erratic over at the cost of just three singles. It might be time for a return to one of Healy’s strike weapons. 25th over: India 111-5 (Harmanpreet 22, Ghosh 4) Australia have blasted this game wide open with two quick hits. Not that Richa Ghosh seems to mind, striding in and drilling King through extra cover for four. She goes again a few balls later, misses, and the prodigious legspin beats everyone and runs away for four byes. Alana King making things happen, as usual. One brings two! And it’s another top-edge down the legside. This time Deepti failing to control King’s extra bounce and sweeping the leggie straight to Sophie Molineux on the 45. 24th over: India 103-4 (Harmanpreet 22, Deepti 2) That wicket breaks the game wide open again for Australia. Mandhana looked set, ready to anchor India’s innings and launch a late assault. Over to Harmanpreet to steer her side to a score. Massive moment in this match! McGrath is given a third over despite looking innocuous, and she repays Healy’s faith. It’s not a great delivery, angling down the legside from around the wicket, but Mandhana gets a top edge to it as she tries to help it on its way, and she picks out King’s safe hands at fine-leg. 23rd over: India 100-3 (Mandhana 58, Harmanpreet 21) King beats Harmanpreet with flight and dip but the Indian plays with such soft hands she’s able to adapt and survive. Then the skipper breaks the long streak of one-run scoring shots with a couple through mid-off after using her feet superbly to engineer some room. 22nd over: India 95-3 (Mandhana 55, Harmanpreet 19) This pair display much more intent to McGrath’s seamers, but still the scoreboard is advancing only in singles. 21st over: India 90-3 (Mandhana 53, Harmanpreet 16) King is putting plenty of energy into her deliveries but India are happy to be watchful, for now, minimising any risk. 20th over: India 87-3 (Mandhana 51, Harmanpreet 15) Tahlia McGrath curtails Gardner’s spell but she starts too short to Mandhana who pulls effortlessly from the crease for the single that brings up her half-century. The Indian opener started scratchily and offered plenty of half-chances to the cordon but is now looking in ominous form. 19th over: India 83-3 (Mandhana 49, Harmanpreet 13) Sensing the match might be drifting a touch Healy turns to the dynamic Alana King to shake things up. It takes five deliveries for something to happen but when it does it’s explosive with the ball spitting and turning off a length to confound Harmanpreet. Around that India are patient and happy to deal in singles for the time being. 18th over: India 79-3 (Mandhana 47, Harmanpreet 11) Gardner continues after drinks and India are happy to knock her for three chanceless singles to keep the scoreboard moving. 17th over: India 76-3 (Mandhana 45, Harmanpreet 10) Annabel Sutherland’s fourth over is a maiden, and easily the best of her spell so far, hitting a consistent line and length and finding some natural variation with the wobble seam. She beats Harmapreet lunging forward and has her fishing from the crease. 16th over: India 76-3 (Mandhana 45, Harmanpreet 10) Gardner leaks some wides down the legside but corrects nicely to have Harmanpreet reaching for a cover drive that goes in the vicinity of Lichfield in the air. Mandhana is looking rock solid at the other end, building the partnership nicely with some proactive running. 15th over: India 70-3 (Mandhana 44, Harmanpreet 8) Both batters have settled into a nice rhythm… but Sutherland hits the seam and beats the outside edge of Harmanpreet’s seam, proving there’s still something in this surface for the right delivery. The all-rounder hasn’t bowled with control in her spell so far though and follows the jaffa with a full toss that is square-driven for four. 14th over: India 63-3 (Mandhana 43, Harmanpreet 2) India milk three singles from Gardner’s second over. There’s a little movement off the pitch but the bigger weapon for the slower bowlers today appears to be drift through the air. 13th over: India 60-3 (Mandhana 42, Harmanpreet 0) Sutherland leaks onto Mandhana’s pads and is whipped for a couple of twos in front of square and a four behind it. The Indian opener already looms as the decisive figure in this contest. 12th over: India 52-3 (Mandhana 34, Harmanpreet 0) That really was magnificent control from Gardner, adjusting perfectly form delivery one to two. Top class glove-work from Mooney too to complete the dismissal. Now it’s up to India’s two big guns to arrest this poor start and set a competitive total for Australia to chase. It’s a double change for Australia, and our first look at spin, with Ash Gardner replacing Darcie Brown. Rodrigues is happy with the change, slog sweeping the first ball for four through square leg – but the bowler exacts immediate revenge, dropping her length, curving the ball away in the air, drawing the batter forward and inducing the skinniest edge through to Mooney. Superb bowling. 11th over: India 48-2 (Mandhana 34, Rodrigues 4) Annabel Sutherland into the attack for Australia, replacing the impressive Megan Schutt – and she almost has Rodrigues feathering behind second ball with some extra bounce from just short of a good length. And again three deliveries later! Excellent line and length from the off by the Australian quick. 10th over: India 47-2 (Mandhana 34, Rodrigues 3) Ooof! Smriti Mandhana is starting to cook. Overpitched from Brown and the Indian opener creams it through extra cover with an effortless drive. Short from Brown and the superstar swivels and pulls with a crisp thwack in front of midwicket for four more. 9th over: India 39-2 (Mandhana 26, Rodrigues 3) Schutt has earned a fifth over in this spell but she has the misfortune of being on the receiving end of the shot of the day so far, Mandhana just leaning into a cover drive that races away for the first boundary in front of square. Rodrigues plays some neat tip-and-run to keep the Australian field on its toes. 8th over: India 31-2 (Mandhana 21, Rodrigues 0) Brown’s successful over ends with Mandhana yet again flashing outside her off stump and earning runs with a very streaky thick edge. Australia have two Indian wickets already but it could easily have been more. Verma has been trying to force the issue, but has failed to sync with the timing of this surface, so it comes as little surprise to see her offer a return catch to an Australian bowler in their follow through. However, considering how many mistimed strokes have bypassed fielders already it is a surprise to see the ball travel directly to Darcie Brown, who completes the catch diving forward halfway down the pitch. Australia right on top. 7th over: India 23-1 (Mandhana 16, Verma 4) Verma is desperate to get going, stepping inside then outside the line but Schutt is giving nothing away. Then Mandhana rides her luck again! Not for the first time today the Indian opener gets an edge to a Schutt outswinger but frustratingly for Australia it flies between diving fielders. This is becoming an exceptional new ball spell. 6th over: India 17-1 (Mandhana 11, Verma 3) Mandhana unfurls her first shot of note, late-cutting Brown for a single down to third that suggests she’s getting the measure of the pace and bounce of this surface. Brown has started reasonably enough but without the metronomic control of her more senior partner. Mandhana latches onto some length for a couple to midwicket and a third wide of the spell keeps the scoreboard ticking over. 5th over: India 12-1 (Mandhana 8, Verma 2) Schutt continues to make the ball talk and Verma is lucky her poorly-timed pull lands safely over the infield. Mandhana then has her outside edge tickled with consecutive deliveries, the second of which squirting for runs between second and third slips. Schutt may not have been the selectors’ first choice to open the bowling but she has come in and started magnificently. 4th over: India 8-1 (Mandhana 5, Verma 1) While Schutt is finding in-swing from over the wicket, Brown is getting the ball to curve pleasingly away out of the hand. Again length is critical with Verma able to rotate strike with a push into the covers form under her nose. Australia on top early. 3rd over: India 6-1 (Mandhana 5, Verma 0) Another chance! Schutt continues to extract prodigious movement off the pitch, drawing a thick outside edge from the left-handed Mandhana but the ball flies between third slip and the diving gully. Length is going to be critical for Australia with the new ball. Good length deliveries look incredibly threatening but Schutt overpitched a couple of times allowing Mandhana to get in line and stride to the pitch of the ball. 2nd over: India 2-1 (Mandhana 1, Verma 0) Darcie Brown, who has had a quiet series so far, shares the new ball. The right-arm quick starts by angling across Mandhana, looking for one to hold its line and draw the edge. The Indian opener is watchful, picking up a single with a compact drive. 1st over: India 0-1 (Mandhana 0, Verma 0) Schutt almost has two! Verma tries to counterattack but mistimes a straight drive that is just out of reach of the bowler’s left hand in her follow through. Outstanding opening over from the experienced South Australian, who wasn’t selected in the original ODI squad, but has come in today with immediate effect, hooping the ball into the right-handers from over the wicket. Schutt’s second delivery swings in from wide on the crease, hits a good line and length, and jags massively off the pitch, pinning Rawal on the crease. That looks very out. The Indian opener reviews but DRS does not save her. What a start for Australia! Megan Schutt has the new ball, looking to exploit any bounce in this pitch, and take advantage of the overcast conditions. Pratika Rawal is on strike. India’s openers head to the square in the vibrant blue uniforms that served them well in the T20s. Australia have ditched the forest green in favour of canary yellow. With the wind coming off the ocean it’s not as hot and muggy as might have been expected at this time of year. Temperatures are in the high 20s with plenty of cloud cover around which may help the ball swing. Thunderstorms have pock marked the region and remain a hazard but should blow through by mid-afternoon. Pratika Rawal is back to open for India after her World Cup injury. Shafali Verma drops down to the middle order. India 1 Smriti Mandhana, 2 Pratika Rawal, 3 Shafali Verma, 4 Harmanpreet Kaur (c), 5 Jemimah Rodrigues, 6 Richa Ghosh (wk), 7 Deepti Sharma, 8 Kashvee Gautam, 9 Sree Charani, 10 Kranti Gaud, 11 Renuka Singh In a huge blow for the hosts Ellyse Perry has been ruled out, which opens the door for Georgia Voll to make some runs, while further down the order Kim Garth has failed to prove her fitness, allowing Megan Schutt an opportunity – Schutt wasn’t even in the original ODI squad, but she has been added along with Lucy Hamilton. Both Perry and Garth have been ruled out of the remainder of the ODI portion of this series with quad injuries sustained in the third T20i. “Their availability for the Test match will be further assessed at the end of the ODI series,” Cricket Australia have said. Australia: 1 Alyssa Healy (c), 2 Phoebe Litchfield, 3 Georgia Voll, 4 Beth Mooney (wk), 5 Annabel Sutherland, 6 Ashleigh Gardner, 7 Tahlia McGrath, 8 Sophie Molienux, 9 Alana King, 10 Megan Schutt, 11 Darcie Brown A fourth consecutive toss win for Harmanpreet Kaur and the world cup winners will get first use of the Allan Border Field pitch. Alyssa Healy would have bowled first anyway. There are some murmurings from the ground that Australia have a couple of significant injuries to contend with. More on that when XIs are confirmed at the toss. Hello everybody and welcome to live coverage of the first ODI of the multi-format series between Australia and India. We’ll be under way at Allan Border Field in Queensland at 1:50pm local time (2:50pm AEDT). These are unfamiliar times for Australian cricket. They are unlikely to last long, but it is nonetheless noteworthy that the normally dominant women’s team are not in possession of either World Cup trophy and lost the T20 series to India that preceded these ODIs, alongside the men being bundled out of their T20 World Cup at the humiliation stage. Mitigating factors abound, most pertinently for us today a changing of the guard as generational greats are replaced by newcomers still refining their craft. At the top of this list is Alyssa Healy, who returns to skipper her country during a valedictory series before international retirement. Healy will captain from the outfield with the veteran already handing over the wicket keeping gloves to Beth Mooney. Sophie Molineux, Healy’s successor as T20 captain, returns to the rank and file. Australia have never lost at AB Field, but they have never faced an Indian side with so much quality or confidence. The recently crowned World Cup winners chased down a massive 339 the last time these teams faced off, and with momentum from the T20s behind them they are unlikely to be fazed by the occasion. I’ll be back with the toss and teams shortly. If you want to get in touch while I’m around, you can reach me at jonathan.howcroft.casual@theguardian.com."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:30:47Z,"Four years since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Putin has not achieved his goals, says Zelenskyy – Europe live","It’s the fourth anniversary of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, when Russian hoped to take the country in three days, and 12 years since the preceding Russian attack on Crimea. As Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his special address this morning: “Looking back at the beginning of the invasion and reflecting on today, we have every right to say: we have defended our independence, we have not lost our statehood; Putin has not achieved his goals. He has not broken Ukrainians; he has not won this war. We have preserved Ukraine, and we will do everything to secure peace and justice.” Several European leaders are expected in Kyiv to mark the anniversary; others will be joining the fourth anniversary meeting of the Coalition of the Willing via a video link. We will hear from Nato’s secretary general Mark Rutte and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, among others, as they no doubt pay tribute to the people of Ukraine. But, despite the intentions, the EU failed to agree a new package of sanctions to put more pressure on Russia after Hungary’s Viktor Orbán vetoed the proposal over a separate dispute about oil transit through Ukraine. I will bring you all the key lines here. If you want to re-live the last hours before the invasion, you can read Shaun Walker’s brilliant story on how the CIA and MI6 got hold of Putin’s Ukraine plans and why nobody believed them. Shaun will be joining me for a Q&amp;A to answer your questions from 2pm UK time. It’s Tuesday, 24 February 2026, it’s Jakub Krupa here, and this is Europe Live. Good morning."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:20:56Z,Mandelson’s downfall is one of fastest ever seen in British public life,"Just six months ago Peter Mandelson seemed unassailable as the UK’s ambassador to the US, one of the most vaunted positions in British diplomacy. As our man in Washington, Mandelson appeared to have used his skill for schmoozing, learned over years as a cabinet minister and a European commissioner, to secure a good relationship with the tricky Trump administration. He was considered instrumental in securing a relatively favourable US trade deal for the UK. He was also an influential voice in Labour politics with the ear of the prime minister and his inner circle, notably his friend and protege Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s then chief of staff. Mandelson’s arrest on Monday marks one of the quickest and steepest descents ever seen in British public life. It began when US lawmakers released some of the Epstein emails in September 2025. In one letter from 2003 Mandelson called Epstein “my best pal”. In a birthday message he described Epstein as an “intelligent sharp-witted man”. It detailed what appeared to be a close relationship and referred to Epstein’s “‘interesting’ friends”. Mandelson’s message about Epstein added: “Very occasionally, taking you by surprise in some far off places … Or in one of his glorious homes he likes to share with his friends (yum yum) … But wherever he is in the world, he remains my best pal!” And an email from Mandelson to Epstein in 2008 said he would “fight for early release” when the disgraced financier was facing charges of soliciting sex. Mandelson defended himself and said he regretted ever meeting Epstein. “I relied on assurances of his innocence that turned out later to be horrendously false,” he told the BBC. But he also conceded to the Sun that more “embarrassing” messages to Epstein were likely to emerge. Keir Starmer initially backed Mandelson in the face of Kemi Badenoch’s claims that his position as ambassador was untenable. At PMQs on 10 September, Starmer said he had full confidence in Mandelson. But only a day later sacked him over the Epstein messages. Explaining the move, the Foreign Office said the messages showed the “depth and extent of Peter Mandelson’s relationship with Jeffrey Epstein is materially different from that known at the time of his appointment”. But in June 2023 the Financial Times had revealed that a JP Morgan report had found evidence Mandelson had stayed in Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in 2009 while Epstein was in jail. As Mandelson signalled, worse was to come. The emails released in September suggested he was in contact with Epstein until 2010. But in November new emails released by the US House oversight committee showed he remained in close contact with Epstein until at least 2016. In December 2025, as more emails began to be released, Mandelson said he thought he was kept away from Epstein’s crimes because he is gay. In January this year, 3m Epstein files were released by the US Department of Justice. They revealed that Epstein had sent thousands of pounds in bank transfers to Mandelson and his partner and now husband Reinaldo Avila da Silva. The money was sent in September 2009, about two months after Epstein was released from prison. In a January 2026 interview with the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg, Mandelson initially declined to apologise for his friendship with Epstein, stating he was “not culpable” and did not know the extent of Epstein’s crime. After a public backlash at his remarks, Mandelson then apologised for his links to Epstein. The latest batch of emails from the US justice department also suggested that Mandelson passed on market-sensitive information to Epstein while serving in Gordon Brown’s government as trade secretary. In a 2009 email Mandelson told Epstein the Treasury was “digging in” on potential new taxes on bankers’ bonuses. Two days later, Epstein asked whether Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan should call the chancellor, Alistair Darling. In reply, Mandelson said he should “mildly threaten” the chancellor. Another 2009 email appeared to be tipping off Epstein about £20bn of saleable assets by the UK government. He also gave Epstein the heads-up on Gordon Brown resigning as prime minister in 2010. These revelations infuriated Brown and others. Writing in the Guardian, the former prime minister said they were “a betrayal of everything we stand for as a country”. The communities secretary Steve Reed said Mandelson had “a moral obligation” to testify to US Congress about what he knew about Epstein. Faced with mounting pressure, Mandelson resigned his membership of the Labour party on 1 February. There were also widespread calls to strip him of his peerage. A week later on 8 February, McSweeney resigned as Starmer’s chief of staff. In a bid to take the heat off Starmer, McSweeney said he took full responsibility for Mandelson’s appointment as ambassador. Last week Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office when he was trade envoy. It was Mandelson who secured the then Prince Andrew the job in 2001, according to his biographer Andrew Lownie. Today Mandelson was arrested on suspicion of the same offence. He denies any wrongdoing. The first batch of the Epstein emails cost Mandelson his job. The last batch may yet cost Mandelson his liberty."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:18:49Z,Albanese says One Nation doesn’t ‘represent working people’ and claims Pocock ‘seeks to promote grievance’,"Anthony Albanese has said One Nation was more likely to represent the interests of mining billionaire Gina Rinehart than working-class Australians and claimed David Pocock “seeks to promote grievances” to win support. In an hour-long YouTube interview with Nine journalist Karl Stefanovic on his independent podcast on Tuesday afternoon, the prime minister discussed a range of topics, from Syrian detention camp repatriations to immigration and One Nation’s surge in popularity. Sign up: AU Breaking News email Albanese is the first Labor politician to appear on the Karl Stefanovic Show which the Today show co-host launched as a solo venture four weeks ago. The guest list has been dominated by right-wing guests, including One Nation politicians Pauline Hanson and Barnaby Joyce, Liberal shadow minister Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and anti-immigration podcasters. While Albanese and Stefanovic were talking, third-party commentators published antisemitic statements and promoted Australian neo-Nazis on a live YouTube comment stream. The comments were later deleted. Stefanovic did not respond to a request for comment about the stream, and it remains unclear who deleted the comments. Albanese, who was interviewed at the Lodge, was asked if One Nation could win seats from Labor because they “better represent” working-class values. Support for One Nation has risen since the 2025 federal election, with experts attributing the minor right-wing party’s increased popularity to the Coalition’s internal turmoil and anxiety over immigration. “They oppose every advance that trade unions have ever made. They oppose – One Nation – one job, one pay, same job, same pay, which has made such a difference. They’ve opposed the legislation that we’ve done to enshrine penalty rates on weekends. They oppose the pay increases that were put for workers in the care sector, like aged care,” he said. “When people look at what policies they have, they don’t represent working people. And of course, One Nation’s greatest supporter, [ Hanson’s] friend is Gina Rinehart. Last time I looked, [Rinehart’s] not a working-class hero, but someone who’s advocated cuts to wages and cuts to working conditions.” Hanson’s ties with Rinehart have been documented in recent years, with the Queensland senator accepting return flights between Brisbane and Florida on Rinehart’s private jet in October to attend the Conservative Political Action Conference and Donald Trump’s Great Gatsby-themed Halloween party at Mar-a-Lago. Albanese said Hanson “represents someone who has always sought division. That is something that she has done throughout her career. “The polling represents people … walking away from the Coalition … that is people expressing that frustration with the system that they think isn’t working for them.” Albanese also took aim at progressive ACT senator Pocock when asked by Stefanovic about claims Australians, on average, were paying more tax on beer than mining companies were for the country’s resources. Initially believing the point to be from the Greens, Albanese said: “The Greens political party would shut down all of our industry if they had the chance”. Once clarified it was a point made by Pocock, the prime minister said: “I think David Pocock is someone who seeks to promote grievance as well”. Albanese was asked to respond to recent comments by Joyce, who told Stefanovic on an earlier podcast that immigrants from “shithole” countries should return to their countries if they did not abide by Australian values. The prime minister said he didn’t agree with the “lack of respect in that sentiment”. “We have a non-discriminatory policy, and one of the things that people from war-torn places, who’ve come here [for], is for a better life,” he said. “Take our Vietnamese migrants that were pilloried for a while by some people, you know? They’re incredible successes.” Albanese wrote to his British counterpart, Keir Starmer, confirming Australia would support any proposal to remove Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor from the royal line of succession after the former prince was arrested on suspicion of misconduct in public office. Asked whether he raised the Mountbatten-Windsor succession issue overnight to “move the story on” from the Australian women and children stuck in a Syrian camp, Albanese said: “Karl, I call bullshit.” Stefanovic said Mountbatten-Windsor was “a feral pig. A disgusting, disgusting feral pig.” Mountbatten-Windsor has always denied any wrongdoing or accusations against him and has not so far been charged with any criminal offence. Nine declined to comment on the vile comments which were published on Stefanovic’s podcast. YouTube parent Google has been approached for comment."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:11:45Z,Donald Trump’s new 10% global tariff comes into effect,"Donald Trump’s new global tariffs have taken effect at 10%, even though he had threatened a higher rate of 15% over the weekend, providing “some relief” for British businesses, according to a lobby group. After the US president suffered a defeat at the hands of the supreme court on Friday, which struck down his sweeping “liberation day” tariffs imposed last year, he angrily reacted by announcing a 10% global tariff, which he raised to 15% on Saturday in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. According to a notice from the US customs agency, “an additional 10% ad valorem duty on imported articles of every country” has been imposed for a period of 150 days from Tuesday, unless specifically exempt. The Trump administration is applying the new duties under section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, without approval from Congress. The 10% rate will apply on top of the US’s most favoured nation duties. The uplift to 15% announced by Trump on Saturday has yet to be implemented, but could be introduced at any time. “While a new 10% tariff rate, instead of the threatened 15%, will provide some relief it shows how difficult it is for businesses to plan ahead,” said William Bain, the head of trade policy at the British Chambers of Commerce. “It is far from clear what will happen next, and whether a higher tariff rate is still on the way. Despite the immediate reprieve, there is fresh uncertainty for UK firms exporting goods to the US.” “This makes it very difficult for firms to understand the prices and margins they will be able to secure for their goods, currently under production, for export in several months’ time. Inevitably this will have an impact on their sales and hit the economy.” Last week, the US’s top court declared many of Trump’s tariffs illegal. It ruled that a 1977 law designed to address national emergencies did not provide the legal justification for most of the Trump administration’s tariffs on countries across the world. Atakan Bakiskan, a US economist at the bank Berenberg, said: “The new section 122 tariffs may also face court challenges, as the current US trade deficit may not meet the condition of “large and serious balance-of-payments” deficits that grant the president authority to impose tariffs to address “fundamental international payments problems.” However, he added: “It would be surprising if the Trump administration, after the 150 days during which the 15% tariffs remain in effect (assuming Congress does not vote to extend them), were to back down from its protectionist trade policy agenda. During this 150-day period, it will likely explore new pathways to move closer to its preferred tariff regime. There are several options available.”"
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T08:00:04Z,Howe’s Newcastle have shown European swagger but may need stylistic switch,"At first glance, Anthony Gordon appears to have little in common with Sir Keir Starmer but, like the prime minister, the Newcastle forward looks infinitely more surefooted on foreign soil than domestic battlegrounds. In the Champions League, Gordon has scored 10 goals in nine games. In the Premier League, meanwhile, he has managed a modest three in 21 appearances, two of which were penalties. Whether deployed wide on the left or, following a recent positional shift, at centre-forward, Gordon seems emblematic of a wider Newcastle paradox. Just like Eddie Howe’s team, he is irrepressible one match and ineffective the next. There is a decent chance of Gordon again leading the attack when Newcastle face Qarabag in the second leg of their Champions League playoff at St James’ Park on Tuesday night. Yet although the 24-year-old scored four against the Azerbaijani champions in Baku last week, the blistering pace and remorseless energy of a player ahead of Nick Woltemade and Yoane Wissa in Howe’s attacking thinking camouflages certain weaknesses. Accordingly, Gordon and company may find things less straightforward when Everton visit Tyneside on Saturday. “I think teams are much more open in the Champions League,” Gordon said recently. “They all try to play proper football, it’s less transitional. The Premier League’s become much more physical than I’ve ever known. It’s so relentless, like basketball. It’s all about running and duels. The Champions League is more of an older style of football; in the Premier League there’s a lot more long throws. It’s a lot more set piece-based now.” Newcastle are second only to Bournemouth among the Premier League’s most athletic teams. At their ferocious, hard-pressing best they are formidable, but a lack of imagination and incision in possession perhaps explains why they are 11th, level on 36 points with 12th-placed Sunderland. Qarabag walked into Howe’s trap by attempting to play out from the back, but more streetwise domestic rivals often cede possession to Newcastle, sit back and watch them do very little with the ball. “We’re better out of possession,” Howe has admitted. “Ultimately our preferred way of play is to go for the throat and try to control games with relentless pressing and really good physical performances.” The problem with tactics based on out-of-possession intensity, non-stop running and a general creation of chaos is that the resultant exhaustion leaves Newcastle at risk of burnout. It is also no match for the best manipulators of the ball, which may explain why Barcelona’s Pedri ended up pulling the strings as Hansi Flick’s side won 2-1 at St James’ Park in September. Howe has certainly evolved from the coach who once regarded Arsène Wenger’s post-Invincibles Arsenal as his ideal template. In more recent times he has instead fallen under the spell cast by two high priests of hard pressing; Bournemouth’s Andoni Iraola and Atlético Madrid’s Diego Simeone. Between leaving Bournemouth and taking charge on Tyneside, Howe visited Spain, shadowing Iraola, then at Rayo Vallecano, and Simeone before deciding imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery. The 48-year-old was at it again after Atlético visited for a friendly last summer and he noted that, straight from kick-off, they directed the ball long and deliberately into touch near a corner flag. The idea was to concede an opposition throw in an area where they could easily regain possession and create a scoring chance. When Sandro Tonali duly booted the ball out for a throw during Newcastle’s first Premier League game of the season at Aston Villa, visiting fans gasped in shock; how had a midfielder who invariably places the ball precisely where he wants it miscued so badly? Tonali was under manager’s orders but the practice was abandoned after the Italian and certain teammates argued it was “anti-football.” Woltemade is another purist presence in Newcastle’s dressing room. The German’s sure touch, adhesive control and improvisational link play is a joy to watch, but unlike Newcastle’s other forwards he lacks pace and is not too hot at pressing. After scoring five goals in his first eight games after arriving from Stuttgart, Woltemade has only one in his past 17 appearances and has been shifted from No 9 to No 10, and most recently to a left-sided No 8 brief. “Nick plays better between the lines than stretching the lines,” according to Howe, who referred, significantly, to the 24-year-old as a midfielder in his preferred 4-3-3 formation. Woltemade could yet prove integral to a more considered, tempo-controlling style that might leave Newcastle less fatigued and less injury-prone. Implementing that sort of philosophical switch would be tricky, yet if they are to challenge for the game’s glittering prizes it appears imperative. Whether or not Howe can pull off such a reinvention remains one of football’s most intriguing questions."
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T07:41:37Z,Tammy Shipley remembered as loving mother who picked tomatoes for her family at inquest into her death,"Tammy Shipley was a loving and joyful mother who adored her five children and two grandchildren, creating TikTok videos and picking tomatoes for her grandchildren from her garden, an inquest has heard. Shipley, 47, died while being held on remand at Silverwater women’s correctional centre in New South Wales on 20 December 2022, after being arrested on minor shoplifting charges. An autopsy found Shipley cause of death was hyponatraemia, caused by extremely low levels of sodium, due to polydipsia (experiencing unquenchable thirst) and complications of schizoaffective disorder. On Tuesday, the court heard from her mother and four of Shipley’s children about their loss. Hayley, 22, became overwhelmed with her grief and her statement was read to the court by a close friend. “She was someone who laughed constantly, cared deeply for her children and was part of our family and community,” she wrote, saying her mother’s death has irrevocably changed her life – altering her mental health, relationships and sense of safety. Sign up: AU Breaking News email “I ask that this court recognise the depth of what has been taken from us: a mother, a daughter, a sister, a nanny, a friend, and most importantly, a woman whose story matters. “Her life mattered, her love mattered, her loss will live with me for the rest of my life.” Chloe, Shipley’s second-eldest daughter and mother of her two grandchildren, told the court that while Shipley had mental health challenges, she’d escaped a domestic violence relationship and provided a safe haven for her children. “My mum opened my eyes for a better life without the abuse and healing after separating from my dad, and I know you’ll be proud of the woman that I am becoming,” saying that it was difficult to tell her children that their grandmother was gone. Shipley survived two bouts of non‑Hodgkin’s lymphoma and her children recalled sitting by her bedside while she received treatment that her mother, Vickey Shipley, said she had to fight for. “I am so angry that during my daughter’s life, I have been her advocate at every institution. All these were meant to be safe and there to protect and help her, but they didn’t,” her mother told the court, saying that she believed her psychiatric conditions were poorly managed at times. “Tammy knew she was unwell, she gave me guardianship and power of attorney so that when she needed a voice, she had one. But in so many instances, it was not worth the paper it was written on. It either wasn’t followed or simply ignored. “We recognise there is a fine line between someone’s freedom and coercively providing them care when at times, they don’t realise they are sick. When Tammy was being appropriately cared for, she was able to live a better life for her her kids, being as much as possible, a normal member of our society.” The inquest had previously heard that NSW police did not tell either the NSW corrections department nor the custody management officers that Shipley suffered from a number of mental health conditions. Earlier, the inquest heard from Prof Olav Nielssen and Prof Michael Large, who both gave extensive evidence into the high-profile Bondi Junction stabbings inquest. Both gave evidence about models of care such as ensuring that there are multidisciplinary support care teams for people living with complex mental health and psychiatric conditions with people likely to access community based support such as GPs. Neither doctors treated Shipley but were familiar with her history and case through the inquest process with Prof Nielssen providing a report to the coroner. An inquest into her death began in September 2024 but was adjourned after the police commissioner challenged the coroner’s jurisdiction to also examine the circumstances of Shipley’s arrest. The inquest, under NSW coroner Teresa O’Sullivan, is continuing. • Indigenous Australians can call 13YARN on 13 92 76 for information and crisis support; or call Lifeline on 13 11 14, Mensline on 1300 789 978 or Beyond Blue on 1300 22 4636"
2026-02-24,2026-02-24T07:00:05Z,"Where tourists seldom tread, part 20: three UK towns that feel like home","The last in this series of underexplored, overlooked, bypassed towns revisits three places loosely linked to somewhere I’ve lived at different stages of my life. Relocating is grand-scale vacationing, as there are a few months when the new place feels like a holiday destination – fresh, strange, not filtered and tainted by habit or prejudice. Going back years later is part-pilgrimage, part-funeral. Harrow The lexicon of suburbia – commuting, dormitory, cul-de-sac, privet hedge – resonates with not seeing. In densely peopled north-west London, you have to dig – with eyes, books and boots – to find the occluded past. In a 767 charter, Harrow is Gumeninga hergae, the “heathen temple of the Gumeningas [tribe]”. The small hill – pronounced on old sketches – was a natural spot for practising worship; harrows are found all over England. Later it was part of the archbishop of Canterbury’s estate and by Domesday had 70 ploughlands, 117 households and 102 villagers, two cottagers, three knights, two slaves and a priest – a sizeable place for 1086. Trees outnumbered people. The medieval manor boasted a 100-hectare (250-acre) deer park in Pinner. The name of Harrow Weald derives from the Old English for woodland, a reference to the Forest of Middlesex that once stretched from Houndsditch in the City of London, through Highgate and Mill Hill, to these outer reaches. It provided pannage (autumn feeding) for 20,000 pigs. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Harrow attracted gentry, who could easily reach court and parliament by coach and four. The wealthy landowner John Lyon founded Harrow school by royal charter in 1572. On an 1868 map, Harrow on the Hill is a mere scattering of houses surrounded by parks, groves and school fields. The only nearby railway line is the London and North Western, arrowing away to Birmingham and Crewe. In 1930, there was enough greenery and wildlife to inspire Harrovian Tom Harrisson (later involved in the Mass-Observation project) to publish Birds of the Harrow District. Metro-land would, by the 1950s, submerge the hill and its environs in housing, lasso it to London, spawn North, West and South Harrows and other subdistricts, and provide suburban living for more than 200,000 people. A more populous, less planned version of this greeted me when I moved there in the summer of 1987, to travel, as Betjeman puts it, “Smoothly from Harrow” on the Metropolitan line “fasts” to a dreary office job in Blackfriars. Knowing, now, a little about this lost town’s historical layers helps explain the still tangible sacrificial feel of the place, the amorphous sensation of inhabiting a populous nowhere. Things to see and do: walk section 9 of the Capital Ring; Headstone Manor Museum; Zoroastrian Centre (former Ace Cinema). Clitheroe I recommend a slow approach to Clitheroe, to take in the setting. A walk into town allows time to admire the hill, the steep-sided lump on which sit the ruins of the Norman castle, with the “second smallest surviving stone keep in England”. From the top of the hill, the views are uplifting: weather coming in from the west, the Bowland Fells, slivers of Yorkshire’s Three Peaks, Pendle Hill. The A59 Lancs-Yorks trunk road became a bypass at the end of the 1960s. Before then, cars and vans chugged up Moor Lane and along Castle Street, which remain the traffic-cluttered sections of the high street. The narrowness and low-slung 17th– and 18th-century shopfronts remind me, in a way, of Totnes, which is largely Tudor. There was a continuity to towns into the modern era, warped by redbrick Victorian pomp and finally shattered by the 20th-century’s brutal raze-and-redevelop wave of shopping precincts (many of them since condemned). In some respects, Clitheroe is archetypal Lancashire. The struggling one-time textile boomtowns to the south of Pendle Hill show what industry did and offshoring took away. Clitheroe, relatively speaking, is intact. Old places seem to weather booms and busts better. New money helps, of course. There were factories here, though. Two former spinning blocks, a weaving shed and offices have been given a creditable makeover to create Holmes Mill: a combined deli-cum-bar, “luxury” cinema, brewery and alehouse, hotel and wedding venue, ticking aspirational boxes for affluent Lancastrians. Lively local boozers are dotted all around town, and Camra groups are probably Clitheroe’s main excursionists. The New Inn is riotously cosy. Georgeonzola does cheese and wine. There are three cocktail bars, at least. No clogs or caps there. I live a couple of miles outside Clitheroe. It’s sometimes strange to think it belongs to the same county as St Helens and Warrington, where I was born and raised. Locals say “Pennine Lancashire”. I’m from the Plains. The rain is worse here, and the wind can be evil, but this north-facing town is a likable knot of streets and stonework; plenty to discover, still. Things to see and do: Edisford Bridge (a swimming spot in summer); walk up Pendle Hill or on the Ribble Way (ideal for winter); Whalley Abbey (by bus or train); the No 11 bus to Bowland and for Pen-y-ghent. Princetown Devon is the least bleak county I know. It has balmy summers, rolling pastures of red earth and green grass, cove-serrated coasts, hamlets, high hedgerows and long lanes, an ecclesiastical city, a maritime city, and mild winters. Princetown is its sole flirtation with grim. Tourists do come, and not as seldom as other spots in this series, but they often look shocked when they get out of their cars or dismount their bikes. The granite-grey Dartmoor prison is the dominant feature of Princetown, as well as the township’s reason for being. Thomas Tyrwhitt MP secured land from the Duchy estate of the Prince of Wales to establish a “depot” for prisoners taken in the Napoleonic wars. It was remote enough to deter escape and sufficiently inhospitable. The first prisoners arrived in 1809 and soon Princetown prison was overcrowded. When US prisoners from the war of 1812 began arriving, conditions deteriorated, and diseases such as pneumonia, typhoid and smallpox became “natural” death sentences. The Depot closed when the conflicts ended, reopening in 1850 as a penal establishment for “common criminals” – which included, over time, the future Irish premier Éamon de Valera, the conscientious objector and MP Frank Longden and Zen poet Reginald Horace Blyth. Tyrwhitt – now Sir Thomas – built a railway to shift quarry stone down to the port and bring up farm produce, coal, timber and lime for fertiliser. Prisoners and passengers used the line at various times until its closure in 1956. The prison was temporarily closed in 2024, due to “higher than normal” levels of radon, a cancer-causing gas formed by decaying uranium in rocks and soils. The old railway is now a track down which runners and cyclists hurtle away from Dartmoor’s anti-twee, anti-wild camping, anti-tourism, possibly radioactive town, or “village”, by population if not for its looks. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle stayed at the Duchy hotel, now the national park visitor centre. An escaped convict, Selden, has a pivotal role in The Hound of the Baskervilles. Between two farmhouses called High Tor and Foulmire and the great prison “extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then is the stage upon which tragedy has played, and upon which we may help to play it again.” For the modern, leisure-age gaze, the moor is a wild camping backdrop and, at least potentially, full of vitality, thanks to its airy solitudes; HMP Dartmoor in Princetown, emptied for now, is the tragic set. Things to see and do: Princetown to Burrator Reservoir mountain bike tracks; Dartmoor Prison Museum; Foggintor Quarry.

2026-02-24,2026-02-24T07:00:05Z,Crazy Old Lady review – Carmen Maura excels as a homicidal pensioner wielding a red hot poker,"Understandably, we tend to think of elderly women as among the most vulnerable in society, and so that means they make excellent nemeses in horror films because no one thinks that an old dear could do much damage. Unless, that is, she’s got a fire poker, a house full of useful clutter, dementia and a violent streak, as is the case with Alicia, played here by the wonderful Carmen Maura, once the lead in Pedro Almodóvar’s Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown. Now 80 years old, still spry as a whippet and clearly up for movie mischief, Maura gives Alicia a dirty glint in her eye as she confuses her daughter’s ex-boyfriend Pedro (Daniel Hendler, showing great comic chops) with her late husband Cesar. He apparently turned Alicia on to some BDSM fun and games in their youth, and may have assisted Alicia in covering up a murder or two. Unless she’s just making that part up – it’s hard to tell what’s true or false given her murky memory. On a dark and stormy night, Pedro arrives at the insistence of his ex Laura (Agustina Liendo) to check on Alicia in the decrepit mansion where she lives alone. Laura is on a road trip with her young daughter (Emma Cetrángolo), but she’s sensed that something’s up, especially since when she called Alicia’s carer, Alicia herself answered the phone. Pedro’s unfortunate resemblance to Cesar gets him lashed to an armchair in chains and duct tape while Alicia quizzes him on their history, with gory results. Argentinian director Martín Mauregui is better known for his work as a screenwriter, but he handles this brisk, chamber piece with skill. Who knows how much producer JA Bayona, himself a dab hand as a director of thrillers and horror (The Orphanage, A Monster Calls, The Impossible), contributed to making this a polished dark comedy of family dysfunction, but we’re here for the chance to appreciate Maura’s impeccable timing and charismatic screen presence. It’s not a deep work, but it’s relentlessly fun if you’re not squeamish, or indeed sentimental about animals getting killed in the opening minutes. • Crazy Old Lady is on Shudder and AMC+ from 27 February."
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:35:20Z,"Energy bills in Great Britain to fall by £117 a year, offering some relief to household budgets – business live","Here’s more reaction: Angharad Hopkinson, political campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: Stripping out levies from our bills will help struggling households, but significantly less than it should, because the cost of electricity is still set by volatile global gas prices. The government’s efforts to make energy more affordable could be wiped out by another gas price spike. People are crying out for lower energy bills, and the government must do more to help them by stopping gas from setting the price we pay for electricity. Energy analysts Cornwall Insight said on X: The UK prime minister and chancellor have both commented on the drop in the UK energy price cap. Keir Starmer said: Energy bills are at the front of everybody’s mind, and I know they’ve been too high for too long. I promised to bring bills down and I meant it. And today – because of the actions this government took at the last budget – the price cap on energy bills has come down by £117. That means lower energy bills for millions across the country, but I know there is more to do and my government is pulling every lever to bear down on the cost of living and protect the pound in the pockets of working people. The cut, which will provide some relief to stretched household finances, follows the November budget, in which the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, shifted some green energy costs away from household bills and into general taxation. She shifted the levies used to support renewable energy projects into general taxation, and scrapped a bill payer-funded energy efficiency scheme. Reeves said: Cutting the cost of living is this government’s number one priority and I know energy bills are one of the biggest concerns, that’s why at the budget I said we would bear down on energy bills. We are cutting the cost of living, cutting the national debt and creating the conditions for growth and investment in every part of the country. It is the right economic plan to build a stronger and more secure economy. It is the lowest price cap rate since October 2024, but experts are saying that some fixed tariffs are better. However, energy prices remain more than £500 (44%) higher than when the price cap was first introduced in 2019. Experts at MoneySuperMarket are warning customers not to fall for the “price cap trap,” saying that several fixed deals on the market are still cheaper than the new cap rate, and calling the cut a “sticking plaster”. Their analysis shows there are already several better fixed tariffs on the market, with a number of fixed deals beating both the current and April cap rate. Kara Gammell at MoneySuperMarket Energy said: Today’s announcement will come as welcome news for families across the country and represents a significant cut to household energy bills. However, much of this reduction comes from adjustments to green levies, rather than energy costs themselves getting cheaper for customers. In fact, some energy bosses are predicting that by 2030 UK electricity costs could be even higher than the peak of the energy crisis in 2022. This makes today’s news something of a sticking plaster and doesn’t necessarily mean energy prices will continue trending downwards. It’s important to remember that the energy price cap isn’t a deal, it’s the maximum suppliers can charge for a standard variable tariff. Right now, there are fixed deals available that may offer savings compared with the current price cap, depending on your usage and circumstances. So, don’t fall for the ‘price cap trap’, be vigilant, shop around and switch if you find a better deal that works for you. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. Energy bills in Great Britain will fall by £117 to a typical annual bill of £1,641 from April, the regulator Ofgem announced this morning. It announced a 7% reduction of the energy price cap for the period covering 1 April to 30 June. This change amounts to a reduction of about £10 a month for the average household using both electricity and gas, Ofgem said. This is more than £200 lower than a year ago. Tim Jarvis, director general in charge of markets at Ofgem, said: Today’s announcement will be welcome news for many households. Wholesale energy prices have fallen in recent months, and we’re investing in our network to safeguard the future energy system. The main driver of today’s reduction is the change to policy costs announced by the chancellor in the budget. We’re also seeing encouraging signs of greater engagement and competition, with switching increasing by almost 20% year on year. More households are choosing time‑of‑use tariffs that offer cheaper off‑peak rates, and suppliers are offering a wider range of products, including deals with savings at evenings or weekends. Gold prices climbed 1% as investors sought out out safe-haven assets amid continued uncertainty over new US tariffs. Donald Trump ’s new global tariffs took effect at 10% for 150 days on Tuesday, but Washington was working to raise it to 15%, according to a White House official, as the US president had threatened on Saturday. Spot gold rose to $5,198 an ounce, after closing more than 1% lower on Tuesday when investors locked in profits. Iran is edging closer to a deal with China to buy anti-ship cruise missiles, Reuters reported, as Tehran and Washington are set to hold a third round of nuclear talks in Geneva on Thursday. Trump proclaimed his first year in office a success at the State of the Union address on Tuesday night, even as his presidency is dogged by low public approval ratings before November’s midterm elections in which voters could hand control of Congress back to his Democratic opponents. He gave the longest-ever State of the Union speech, lasting almost 1 hour and 50 minutes – a speech that was interspersed with falsehoods and exaggerations but light on new policy proposals. The president briefly set out his case for a possible attack on Iran, saying he would not allow the country to have a nuclear weapon.

2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:31:51Z,Energy bills will fall by £117 for millions of households in Great Britain from April,"Annual energy bills will fall by £117 for millions of households from April after Rachel Reeves’s plan to cut £150 a year from bills was partly foiled by rising costs. The energy regulator Ofgem’s quarterly cap will fall by 7% a year for the three months from April to £1,641 for the average combined gas and electricity bill in Great Britain, from £1,758 under the current January-March cap. The cut, which will provide some relief to stretched household finances, follows the November budget, in which the chancellor shifted some green energy costs away from household bills and into general taxation. However, the fall is smaller than the £150 cut in April promised by Reeves, as her cuts were partly offset by the increased cost of maintaining and upgrading the UK’s energy networks. Despite the fall in the price cap, which dictates the maximum that suppliers can charge their 29 million household customers for each unit of gas and electricity, domestic energy costs remain about a third higher than before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine triggered the European energy crisis. Bills have remained higher since, pushing Britain’s energy debts to record levels, in part because gas market prices remain inflated because of the cost of importing more gas by tanker from the US and the Middle East – but also because of the higher costs of the UK’s energy transition. Network charges increased by £66, Ofgem said. Reeves said at the budget: “I can tell you today that for every family we are keeping our promise to get energy bills down and cut the cost of living with £150 cut from the average household bill from April next year.” The chancellor shifted the levies used to support renewable energy projects into general taxation, and scrapped a bill payer-funded energy efficiency scheme. The savings will apply to all households, regardless of which tariff they are on, but will differ depending on how much energy they use. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, said on Wednesday: “I know there is more to do and my government is pulling every lever to bear down on the cost of living and protect the pound in the pockets of working people.” Tim Jarvis, the director general of markets at Ofgem, said: “Today’s announcement will be welcome news for many households. “Wholesale energy prices have fallen in recent months, and we’re investing in our network to safeguard the future energy system. The main driver of today’s reduction is the change to policy costs announced by the chancellor in the budget.” Peter Smith, a director at National Energy Action, a fuel poverty charity, said: “Any fall in sky-high energy bills is welcome. But the new level is still far from affordable. Those on the lowest incomes in the leakiest homes will face deep debt and will still struggle to stay warm and well at home.” Clare Moriarty, the chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: “A fall in energy prices is welcome but for many people bills remain stubbornly high. For millions of households this has stopped being a temporary hardship and become an ongoing threat to their financial stability. “The government has taken steps in the right direction to bring down bills. However, planned changes to how warm home discount costs are recovered mean those who need it most – households on low incomes with the highest energy needs – could keep as little as half the support in practice.” The cost of electricity in the UK, which is among the highest in the developed world, has emerged as a key political dividing line after the opposition parties Reform UK and the Conservatives pledged to cut costs for households and businesses by scrapping key elements of the government’s plan to reach net zero to boost the economy. Craig Lowrey, the principal consultant at Cornwall Energy, a leading consultancy, said there needed to be “an open conversation about the fact that such a transition will not be cost‑free”. He said: “Bills aren’t going to drop by two or three hundred pounds overnight, but long-term progress is possible if we stick with the transition. Ultimately, a move to homegrown energy gives us a stronger chance of eventually achieving price stability while providing greater energy security in the process.” When adjusted for inflation, the new cap is 12.3%, or £231, lower than the same period in 2025, Ofgem said. Wholesale prices, which make up the largest part of the bill, fell by 6% over the last three months."

2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:01:04Z,Russian firms have routed $8bn of trade through British island territories since invasion of Ukraine,"Russian companies have used Britain’s secretive island territories to conduct $8bn (£5.9bn) of trade since the invasion of Ukraine, according to a report that highlights the flow of goods ranging from oil-drilling equipment to luxury yachts linked to Moscow’s political elite. The analysis, published a day after the fourth anniversary of Russia’s assault on its neighbour, raises questions over the role played by the British overseas territories in enforcing sanctions designed to turn the screw on the Kremlin. Written in exile by the Russian office of the anti-corruption group Transparency International, the report uncovers trade deals involving more than 150 luxury yachts, dozens of aircraft and equipment destined for Russia’s money-spinning oil sector. Analysis of 29,000 transactions identified: Yachts linked to allies of Vladimir Putin. Drilling kit for Kremlin-backed oil projects. Coal linked to Ukraine’s pro-Russian ex-president. A jet linked to the Chechen warlord Ramzan Kadyrov. Researchers found that more than 95% of the trade, uncovered by scouring official data, was routed through four territories: the British Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar. Most transactions took place in the immediate aftermath of international sanctions being imposed in 2022, although Transparency International also found many more recent deals in the data, which runs up to January 2025. Deals in 2022 include 65 transactions that use the description “yacht”, often using offshore entities as part of transfers between Turkey and the Russian port of Sochi, across the Black Sea. The number of yacht trades increased to 97 in 2023, including deliveries to parts of Crimea that had been annexed by Russia. One of the vessels that appears in Cayman Islands trade data, the $100m (£74m), 74-metre Universe, has previously been linked to Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chair of Russia’s security council and the country’s former president, who is sanctioned by the UK. Another, named the Marlin, was delivered to Russia via a Cayman Islands company in 2022, trade data showed. According to a report by the independent Russian media outlet Proekt, it was bought by the oligarch Suleyman Kerimov, who then gave it to a senior figure in Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. Kerimov is also on the UK sanctions list. A spokesperson for Cayman Finance said UK sanctions laws applied on the island and were “immediately enforced”. They said more than $9.7bn (£7.2bn) of Russian assets had been frozen as part of a joint effort with the UK government known as Operation Hektor, adding that the UK minister for overseas territories, Stephen Doughty, had called the operation an “excellent example of best practice”. Of the $8bn in trade analysed by Transparency International, $4.4bn involved companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI), whose government has been warned by the UK for dragging its feet on plans to introduce a publicly available register of corporate ownership. Companies linked to the family of the sanctioned pro-Russian former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych have reportedly sent coal mined in the occupied territories of Ukraine to Turkey, according to the Latvia-based Russian outlet iStories. The proceeds from these sales were reportedly routed to offshore accounts registered to a BVI company found in the trade data. Transparency International said the BVIs were unusual among the overseas territories in that most of the transactions involving the islands were exports from Russia, including the purchase of natural resources from Russian companies. “This may indicate a particular priority for Russian companies in their attempts to conceal trade income,” researchers said. A BVI spokesperson said the data “does not appear to refer to any actual sanctions breaches”, adding that the BVI had frozen more than $400m in Russian assets in 2022. The islands’ government has created a dedicated sanctions unit to implement and enforce UK sanctions locally, the spokesperson added. The second most commonly used jurisdiction among the overseas territories is Bermuda, with a volume of nearly $3bn. Russian companies used Bermuda entities to pay for drilling equipment in the oil and gas industry, the report found, including gas turbines and piles destined for a division of the Sakhalin Energy group, which is building the vast Sakhalin-2 oil and gas pipeline. The UK oil company Shell pulled out of the Sakhalin project in 2022 and it is now majority owned by the Kremlin-backed Gazprom. A Bermuda company also appears to have acted as the intermediary in the $55m sale by a Dubai-based company of an Airbus RA-73417 aircraft, which Russian journalists have reported was bought by the family of the sanctioned Chechen warlord leader Ramzan Kadyrov. “Unfortunately, for many years now, we have observed a dysfunctional equilibrium in which illicit financial flows, tax evasion, sanctions circumvention and other forms of misconduct are channelled through firms and intermediaries registered in unaccountable jurisdictions,” Transparency International said. The UK government has demanded that overseas territories such as the BVIs and Bermuda and crown dependencies such as Jersey and the Isle of Man introduce fully accessible registers of beneficial ownership. However, the UK has been accused of caving in to the BVI government by allowing it to limit who can access its new register. Gibraltar said it was a “leader in transparency” as the first overseas territory to establish a register of beneficial ownership, adding that transactions involving Gibraltar companies made up less than 1% of the trade in the report. The Guardian approached representatives of Bermuda for comment."
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:00:05Z,Behind the Guardian’s analysis of 100 years of MPs’ language on immigration,"The Guardian has revealed a significant rightward shift toward sentiment relating to immigration among MPs speaking in the House of Commons in the past five years. To do this analysis the Guardian’s Data Science and Data Projects teams, in collaboration with University College London, developed an in-house machine learning model to measure linguistic sentiment in debates in the Commons over the course of a century. Unlike off-the-shelf sentiment models, the Guardian’s version distinguishes sentiment directed specifically at immigration from general emotionally charged language about any topic. The development of the model involved the following process: The researchers first used a list of trigger terms manually designed and verified by experts on immigration history to identify speeches most likely to be about immigration. This process narrowed the data down to a manageable sample. To ensure the results were not biased by the choice of keywords, the team stress-tested their findings, running the analysis many times with different combinations of words and proving similar findings regardless of the specific combination of terms. To build the dataset on which the sentiment model was trained, a team of 12 people manually labelled more than 1,250 fragments of parliamentary speeches and contributions over a century that were up to five sentences each. Where the fragment was about immigration it was identified as such, and then classified as either positive, negative or neutral. Fragments that did not relate to immigration were classified as not about immigration. The team also assessed the performance of several Large Language Models – which are a form of generative AI – for the purpose of labelling more fragments; statistical testing deemed their accuracy level to be robust. The use of AI in this project was limited to the annotation process, which increased the training dataset used to develop the Guardian machine learning model up to more than 22,600 fragments of annotated parliamentary contributions in the last century. The bespoke model was then applied to a century’s worth of debates and speeches made in the Commons, capturing almost 238,000 fragments relating to immigration between 1925 and the end of 2025, with each of them given a “sentiment label”. The overall sentiment score for each year was calculated using only the fragments relating to immigration (a full speech can combine fragments that relate to immigration with ones that don’t). The annual score was then calculated by subtracting the number of negative snippets from the positive ones and dividing the result by the number of all snippets about immigration. This was also done individually for the main parties highlighted within the analysis. As the model was built to measure sentiment in parliamentary speeches in aggregate, it has not been used to report the sentiment of individual contributions. The analysis has also excluded period of times for specific parties when there has not been enough contributions about immigration over a consistent period of time."
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:00:05Z,What is the earliest in a season that a football team has been relegated? | The Knowledge,"“With Sheffield Wednesday on the brink of relegation in February [update: they’re now down], what is the earliest a team has been demoted to another division?” asks Kevin Bartholomew. The earliest confirmed relegation in a season we can find is Peterborough United, in 1967-68, who were relegated from the third tier with a whopping 27 games remaining. After the club were found guilty of breaking league rules relating to match-fee incentives and signing-on bonuses, a Football League management committee confirmed in mid-November of 1968 that Posh would be relegated, whatever their final league placing or points tally. Despite finishing ninth with 50 points, Peterborough were docked 19 of them, rendering them bottom. The club were relegated having scored 79 goals that season, which made them more prolific than all but one of the other teams in Division Three, including champions Oxford United. There is no other example in English football that can beat Sheffield Wednesday’s February relegation with 13 matches to go, but if we remove points deductions and only include seasons where three teams are relegated, Cambridge United are the next best/worst example, relegated from the third tier in 1984-85 with eight games to spare. This was all the more remarkable given they had only just been relegated from the second tier the previous year (with six games to spare). Doncaster Rovers match Cambridge, falling out of the Football League for the first time in their history after relegation from the old Third Division in 1997-98, also with eight games to spare. To say Doncaster were a bin fire of a club that season was an understatement, particularly because just a few weeks after their relegation was confirmed, chairman Ken Richardson was found guilty of hiring a former SAS trooper to burn down the main stand at the club’s Belle Vue Stadium in a property development scam. Richardson came unstuck after the man he hired, Alan Kristiansen, left petrol cans and a haversack at the scene as well as his mobile phone at the badly burned main stand along with a message on Richardson’s answering machine saying: “The job’s been done.” Kristiansen became the main prosecution witness against Richardson after pleading guilty to arson. There are a number of other English clubs that have been relegated with seven games to go. This list includes Southampton (from the Premier League) last season and Watford (second tier, 1971-72) – despite the fact that only two clubs went down from each of the top two divisions until 1974, Watford were mathematically unable to catch even the third-bottom team with seven matches to spare. The list of clubs relegated with seven games to go also numbers Stoke City (top flight, 1984-85), Stockport County, (second tier, 2001-02), Wimbledon, (second tier, 2003-04), Rotherham United (second tier, 2016-17), and Oxford United (third tier, 2000-01), with the latter relegated in the final season at the Manor Ground before the move to the Kassam Stadium. Ouch. Can you do better than the above in leagues outside England? Emails to the usual place: knowledge@theguardian.com. Top and tail “Assuming Arsenal win the league and Wolves remain bottom, are there any other instances of a league’s top and bottom teams also being first and last alphabetically?” asks Martin Villau. Great question! We should caveat this by saying that some people count AFC Bournemouth as the first team listed alphabetically in the Premier League, but most don’t … so we’ll let it slide. Chris Roe writes in to answer this one. “In English league history it is almost identically common for the first and last alphabetic team to finish in those positions (26 for the first v 25 times for the last),” he writes. “Of those, there are just two seasons in which the top and bottom teams have also been first and last alphabetically. In Arsenal’s unbeaten title run of 2003-04, the other end of the table was super close with Wolves ending up bottom on goals scored from Leeds United, when both ended on 33 points and a goal difference of -39. “Then we go back to the second tier in 1892-93 and this one comes with an asterisk beside it, as the alphabetical requirement is only satisfied if we use the clubs’ current names, rather than those at the time. Walsall (then Walsall Town Swifts) were bottom which worked alphabetically, but it was champions Small Heath (now Birmingham City) who come first alphabetically on current names, but clearly not on the names at the time!” A perfect circle “In Napoli’s 2-2 draw with Roma earlier this month, there were only three corners in total. How many matches have had fewer? And has a match ever played out without any corners at all?” asks Mykyta Shchehlov. Apparently during the match between Wigan and Chelsea in the Premier League on 21 August 2010, there were no corners at all. Chelsea won 6-0 with braces from Nicolas Anelka and Salomon Kalou and a hat-trick of assists from Didier Drogba. According to Opta, this was the first game without any corners since they started covering matches. Knowledge archive “Scott Dobbie of Queen of the South, age 36, had scored 37 goals by the end of January this season,” explained David Forbes in 2019. “Who is the oldest player to have outscored their age in a season?” “At top level, the legendary Ferenc Puskás takes some beating,” reckoned David Warriston. “By the end of 1961-62, the Magyar maestro was 35 and had scored 40 goals for Real Madrid, including a first-half hat-trick in that year’s European Cup final. He was clearly on the slide however; the following season he failed to beat his age, netting a meagre 31 goals.” Tim Dockery had more: “Even at 39, Patrizia Panico was inducing panic among her opponents. When the 2013-14 season ended in Women’s Serie A, she was the top scorer with 43 goals for Associazione Sportiva Dilettantistica Torres Calcio Femminile. During that time, she also scored four goals for Torres in cup competitions, bringing her total for the year to 47.” Room for one more. “Lee Trundle scored 45 league goals in 23 appearances for Llanelli Town in 2016-17, when he turned 40,” noted Dave Johnston. “He scored 53 in all competitions that season, in only 31 appearances. Llanelli Town were promoted to the Welsh Football League Division One.” Can you help? “A few weeks ago, Sandra Jessen started for FC Köln against Essen,” notes James Vortkamp-Tong. “Is this the first time a player has contained the opposing side’s name in their own?” “Trawling through various South and Central American leagues, one comes across the likes of Barcelona, Arsenal, Everton, Liverpool and others. Have any of these teams ever played against their European namesake?” queries Paul Huby. “There seem to be very few players from outside the state system in top-tier British teams now,” emails Mark Burns. “Who was the last British international player that was privately educated?” “With kits of purple, amber and claret, green, green hoops, and tangerine, top-flight Scottish clubs seem to have much more diverse kits than those in England,” writes James Bolle. “Is this true, or just my perception? If true, why? Is the English colour palette out of step with the rest of the world, or the Scottish one?” “Like many I remember the Channel 4 Italian football days fondly,” recalls Daz Pearce. “One random stat I remembered was that Piacenza went two whole seasons between 1995 and 1997 without winning a single away match, yet managed to survive both on the strength of their home form. What’s the longest such run managed by a team in a major European league?” Mail us with your questions and answers"
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:00:04Z,"I was at the Baftas – and while hearing the N-word was unsettling, all anger should be aimed at the BBC | Jason Okundaye","I attended the Bafta awards on Sunday. And I arrived early enough to hear the Tourette syndrome (TS) campaigner John Davidson, on whom the biographical film I Swear is based, be introduced. He stood up to wave and take in the applause, and we were told that due to his TS, we might expect to hear involuntary vocal outbursts, known as tics, and that we should understand that the Baftas are an inclusive space in which all people are welcome. Perhaps half the people were listening, others would have been on their phones or engaged in mild chatter. But the tics were instantly audible. When the host, Alan Cumming, was on stage we heard “boring” and there was laughter. When the outgoing chair of Bafta, Sara Putt, was speaking, we heard “shut the fuck up” and there was a mix of knowing silence and confusion. But, as you all now know, it was when Sinners actors Michael B Jordan and Delroy Lindo presented an award that the tics transmuted from things that would be read as benignly antisocial to more outright offensive, as we heard the N-word. There were gasps and whispers of “did he just say … ?” Many will wonder how it felt to be a black person in the room in that moment, hearing that incendiary word, which carries with it generational histories of pain and brutality. And I suppose you would expect that I was immediately upset or angered by it. In truth, the most I felt was a degree of awkwardness. It was right that Davidson was invited into this space (any suggestion that he should’ve been confined to a separate room or contained in a soundproof box is, plainly, discrimination) and also that the possibility of tics was mitigated with a disclaimer. But, God, isn’t this the worst possible outcome you could imagine? I even started laughing, thinking of everything that came together here at once. I also felt immensely sad for Jordan and Lindo, seeing their faces drop as they stood on stage only to hear that word. There is no amount of warning that could truly prepare you for how the word can send shockwaves through your body. And so I empathised with their mental strength and magnanimity to simply go on and continue with their duties. Any condemnation of Davidson is not only futile but actively unhelpful. I have seen much online commentary suggesting that his tics were akin to a Freudian slip, an impulsive communication of internally held thoughts. But this is a misunderstanding of TS. Coprolalia, the specific tic disorder leading to utterances of obscene and socially taboo language, is not a communication of subconscious thoughts or desires. This is not a situation akin to a white person becoming angry at a black person and yelling a slur. This is more akin to saying “fuck the queen” while collecting an MBE from her, as Davidson in fact did. It is something that you do not want to do, but that has come out of you without you even thinking about it – and it is inherently related to the social context presented in front of you. In 2011, the BBC released the documentary Tourettes: I Swear I Can Sing featuring Ruth Ojadi, a black woman with the condition. The disruption to her life that she described was unimaginable. As for her expletives? “No race, no denomination, no gender, no sexuality, no religion is safe,” she said. Such a condition should only be met with deep empathy and understanding. Davidson has said that he is “deeply mortified if anyone considers my involuntary tics to be intentional or to carry any meaning”. Some have criticised this for not amounting to a proper apology. But I am not sure what exactly an apology from him would do in this instance. The reality of the condition is that if Davidson were to meet Lindo or Jordan, or any of the other black attenders of the event, we would probably hear the N-word again – and that would be no fault of his own. Some have also framed this as a test of competing rights: of disabled people to be in a public space, and of black people not to be met with racially offensive language. That feels divorced from reality. In that space on Sunday, Davidson’s presence alone did not impinge on my rights or those of any other black person. It is an uncomfortable truth that inclusion will be jarring and emotionally complicated for a host of reasons. That this has concerned such a slur has been deeply unfortunate. But a TS tic is not the same as racial abuse with intent. What I cannot countenance is the BBC’s decision not to edit out the N-word tic, despite there being a delay in broadcast. Producers have claimed that they “didn’t hear” the slur as they were working from trucks. Even if this was the case, Warner Bros, the studio behind Sinners, reportedly raised the issue with Bafta and was assured that the word would be removed before broadcast. It also doesn’t wash considering that the decision was made to edit “Free Palestine” out of Akinola Davies Jr’s winning speech. And why did nobody speak to Jordan and Lindo after the incident? In the past few years in the UK, we have had race riots and far-right demonstrations, while public discourse around race has degraded – and race and religious hate crimes have increased in England and Wales. In that context, an N-word outburst at two black actors can look and feel like a culmination of broader societal breakdown. In that way, everyone has been failed – Davidson made to look like an avatar for British racism, black people left to feel confused and angry while instructed to remain graceful and tolerant. I left the room with a sense of understanding, even if I was a little unsettled by the incident. But I have been left much sadder by the broadcaster’s negligence. This episode could have been the right opportunity for awareness and education. Yet our institutions seemingly remain completely unfit to meet the moment.

2026-02-25,2026-02-25T08:00:04Z,Onana intent on reclaiming place in Manchester United team next season ,"André Onana wants to fight to re-establish himself as Manchester United’s No 1 when his season’s loan at Trabzonspor finishes in May and believes he will be given a chance to do so. The 29-year-old signed for the Turkish club on 11 September after his erratic form moved United to sign Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for £18m. He is due to report for pre-season training at United. Onana joined United from Inter in July 2023 on a five-year contract for an initial £44.1m but proved too inconsistent, making a series of errors. Erik ten Hag signed the Cameroonian and made him the first choice but his successor Ruben Amorim dropped Onana for April’s trip to Newcastle after the goalkeeper was culpable for both goals in a 2-2 draw at Lyon, and left him out at the start of this season. Despite Onana’s understanding that he will have a chance to compete for the No 1 jersey, he faces a struggle to reclaim it given the impressive form of Lammens. The 23-year-old has been impressive in his debut campaign in English football, keeping five clean sheets in 21 Premier League games and displaying an assured calmness. In Monday’s 1-0 win at Everton the Belgian made a number of vital saves and dealt well with set plays. After, he drew praise from Michael Carrick. “You want a goalkeeper to be reliable, trustworthy and, instead of creating the chaos, you want him to take the chaos away and calm things down,” said the interim manager. “I think Senne is that. He’s quite quiet at times and unassuming but he’s got a real steeliness. To step in, it’s a big role – for some.”"
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T07:27:23Z,Craig Tiley departs Australia having indelibly changed the tennis landscape,"Craig Tiley arrived as Tennis Australia’s director of tennis in 2005 and, two decades and two high-profile roles later, will leave behind a complex and formidable legacy. The Australian Open, which he has overseen since his 2006 appointment as tournament director, has expanded into the acclaimed event that dominates the sporting landscape each January. As chief executive of TA since 2013, Tiley’s dual roles have extended his influence beyond the grand slam’s monster success. Entirely Tiley? No, but the highest-paid sports administrator in the country has built both an impressive empire and a reputation as a political maestro. A bold innovator with limitless ambition for himself and the event shaped in his player-accommodating vision. By most measures – attendance, eyeballs, prize money, athletes’ praise – Tiley built on the solid foundations he inherited to transform the Australian Open into a colossal entertainment and sport event. Probably in that order too, entertainment then sport, for on-court offerings have long been just one part of a package that is now more about music, food and partying than serves and backhands. Tiley was a masterful operator unafraid to harness narratives to suit his plans. He leveraged concerns that the Open could be pinched by Sydney, or even China or the Middle East, to attract state government investment in facilities – including three state-of-the-art roofed stadiums. A Sunday start to expand the event to 13 days, as at Roland Garros, was explained as a way to help avoid the late night sessions that could stretch into early mornings, when it was mostly about the extra dollars generated by spreading the opening round across three days rather than two. This year’s rebadging of the tournament as a three-week event when “Opening Week” was still just qualifying and multiple exhibitions, plus the smash hit that was the million dollar One Point Slam: all trademark Tiley. But given that it propelled crowd numbers from the 554,858 in 2007 to an extraordinary 1.4 million in 2026, is anyone arguing about his approach? Only some of the general public stuck in the crush and the queues as corporate guests and influencers breeze past, and those who chafe at the growing commercialism. There has also been a touch of Teflon about his reign. Somehow, Tiley weathered the criticism over the handling of the Novak Djokovic as the pandemic lingered in 2022, when the unvaccinated world No 1 was deported on tournament eve after a spell in hotel detention and tennis dominated the headlines for all the wrong reasons. In fact, Tiley nominated surviving the immense challenges posed by Covid – including a $100m loss on the 2021 edition played amid strict quarantines and protocols – as among his proudest achievements, along with the transformation of the AO and performance and participation. Australian player development remains the most problematic area of Tiley’s time at the top of TA, given that US import Maya Joint heads the Australian WTA singles rankings at No 29, and world No 80 Kim Birrell is the only pathway product among the four in the top 100. Meanwhile, there’s a significant gap between world No 6 Alex de Minaur and Alexei Popyrin at No 45, and limited emerging talent. Noting, too, that the tensions around the tenure of Davis Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt existed long before this month’s Demon-less flop in Ecuador. In one of his many interviews since confirming his departure, Tiley listed providing more seats, shade, space and screens as priorities for his replacement. Which is all fine in a tournament operations sense, but a few more star players in the post-Barty pipeline would be welcome, too. As for the future, with the board preferring that the roles of TA and Australian Open boss remain in one pair of hands, the favoured internal candidates are chief tennis officer, Tom Larner, and events boss, Stephen Farrow, as well as Tennis Queensland chief executive, Cam Pearson. But some are sceptical that framework is sustainable post-Tiley, given his workaholism and penchant for control. While international executive recruitment firm Egon Zehnder has been engaged to run the search process, Tiley will stay on for several months and play a key role in choosing a successor, who he says will probably come from within tennis. With the top job at the United States Tennis Association waiting, and given he leaves behind a strategic plan through to 2030, it seems his influence will stretch across two continents now. Regardless, Tiley returns to the US homeland of his wife, Ali, at the age of 64 to head a far bigger and more complex organisation, having made an outsized impact on the Australian tennis landscape, elevating its showpiece event and cultural footprint while navigating some choppy waters along the way."
2026-02-25,2026-02-25T07:02:04Z,Trump delivers longest-ever State of the Union address – as it happened,"Donald Trump delivered a historically long State of the Union address on Tuesday evening in which he made a series of claims about his policy successes, despite his approval rating being at 36%, according to latest polling figures. Here’s a wrap-up of key moments from his speech, as well as reactions: He introduced the US men’s Olympic hockey team at the beginning of his speech, saying: “Here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud.” The move came shortly after Trump stirred controversy by joking to the men’s team that he “guesses” he would have to invite the women’s team – which also won gold – to the White House as well. Democratic representative Al Green, held up a sign that said “Black people aren’t apes!”, a reference to Trump recently sharing a racist video depiction of Barack and Michelle Obama. Green ultimately left the chamber after being confronted by several Republicans. Trump bemoaned the supreme court’s ruling that he exceeded his presidential authority by implementing many global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The president called the supreme court’s ruling “unfortunate”, as the four justices attending the address sat right in front of him. The president repeated his xenophobic comments that the “Somali pirates ransacked Minnesota” through “bribery, corruption and lawlessness” during his speech. Democratic representative Ilhan Omar from Minnesota called the president a “liar” from her seat in the audience. More than an hour and a half into his address, Trump mentioned the escalating tensions with Iran. “My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy. But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world’s No 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,” he said. Trump announced new “ratepayer protection pledges”, claiming they will protect Americans from rising electricity costs driven by increased demand from AI datacenters. “We’re telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,” he said. Abigail Spanberger, Virginia’s Democratic governor, delivered the party’s response to Trump’s State of the Union address. She went on to admonish the Trump administration for the violent immigration crackdown throughout the country – particularly in Minnesota, and also criticized him for his “reckless trade policies.” Annie Farmer, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors and a guest of the representative Robert Garcia at the State of the Union address, issued a pointed rebuke after Donald Trump’s address, saying she and other survivors in the chamber were “met with silence”. Farmer said Trump had pledged to bring Epstein’s network of abuse into the open, yet “powerful individuals remain shielded” and basic questions – including why authorities failed to act when her sister, Maria Farmer, reported Epstein in 1996 – remain unanswered. Several speakers at the People’s State of the Union rally encouraged Americans to exercise their right to vote, looking ahead to November’s midterm elections. “Voting is our superpower,” one attendee shouted as California senator Adam Schiff explained how voting and elections are under threat. One of Trump’s most prized policies is his “most favored nation” drug pricing with several pharamceutical companies. The president claimed in his speech: “I took prescription drugs, a very big part of health care, from the highest price in the entire world to the lowest.” Trump also flaunted his new TrumpRx website where people can obtain discounts for certain medications. However, as my colleague Melody Schreiber reported earlier this month, Trump’s new website lists only a limited number of medications, with many of them costing less in generic form elsewhere. Moreover, across the US, healthcare is set to be even more expensive amid the expiration of the Affordable Care Act tax credits, as well as Republican proposals in Congress that seek to slash nearly $1bn in Medicaid funds. Donald Trump delivered a historically long State of the Union address in which he boasted about a series of successes despite his approval rating being at 36%, according to a new CNN poll. The poll, conducted just days before his address, also found only 32% of Americans believe that Trump has the right priorities while 68% believe that he has not focused enough on the country’s most important issues. The latest approval ratings mark a significant decrease from last year when a CNN poll found that Trump had an all-time high of 48% approval before his 2025 State of the Union address. Among Republicans, strong approval towards Trump dropped from 64% last year to 49% this year. The CNN poll also found that nearly three in 10 Republicans believe that Trump has not focused on core issues of the country while 16% indicated that his policies will shift the country towards a wrong direction. Nevertheless, Trump took center stage tonight to make a series of claims about the US’s economic successes, including his false claim that his tariffs have led to “no inflation” and “tremendous growth” across the US. Several speakers at the People’s State of the Union rally encouraged Americans to exercise their right to vote, looking ahead to November’s midterm elections. “Voting is our superpower,” one attendee shouted as California senator Adam Schiff explained how voting and elections are under threat. “Between now and November, the president will make every effort to discourage Americans from voting. He will make it harder to register and turn out,” Schiff said. “He may send ICE agents to polling places to intimidate our citizens. He will cast doubt on the results when his party loses.” The crowd erupted in cheers when Schiff asked: “Are you ready to throw the bums out in November? Are you ready to defend our democracy?” During his address, the president urged lawmakers to pass the Save America Act, the bill that would require proof of citizenship in order to vote. The legislation, which passed 218 to 213, now faces an uphill battle in the Senate. Trump, along with many of his Republican allies in Congress, have routinely railed against non-citizens voting in US elections, when the actual number of those committing voter fraud is exceedingly small. A reminder that it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal races. Nevertheless, Trump repeated his common, baseless refrain that “cheating is rampant in our elections” during his speech. According to a recent report by the non-partisan Center for Election Innovation and Research (CEIR), while investigations do reveal instances of noncitizens who have registered to vote or cast a ballot, “such instances are rare, detected by election officials, and prosecuted by the proper authorities”. For example, CEIR noted that Michigan’s department of state audited its voter rolls in early 2025, comparing millions of driver records with the state’s voter file. The review found 16 apparent noncitizens who voted in the 2024 general election. All were referred to the attorney general for possible charges. The total represents an extremely small share of the electorate – about 0.00028% of all Michigan votes cast. Annie Farmer, one of Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors and a guest of the representative Robert Garcia at the State of the Union address, issued a pointed rebuke after Donald Trump’s address, saying she and other survivors in the chamber were “met with silence”. Farmer said Trump had pledged to bring Epstein’s network of abuse into the open, yet “powerful individuals remain shielded” and basic questions – including why authorities failed to act when her sister, Maria Farmer, reported Epstein in 1996 – remain unanswered. The administration’s handling of the Epstein files has become an unrelenting flashpoint. Earlier Tuesday, Democrats on the House oversight committee launched an inquiry into whether the justice department withheld materials involving allegations against Trump in its latest document release. “While the DoJ might want to wash their hands of Epstein, this fight is far from over. The president can still live up to his promise,” Farmer said. “I’m here to fight for the whole truth survivors and the American people deserve.” During his State of the Union address, Donald Trump vowed to “always protect” Medicaid. This is the federal health insurance program for low-income Americans that saw steep cuts with the passage of the president’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The congressional budget office estimated the sweeping tax policy legislation would reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793bn, and increase the number of uninsured people by at least 7.8 million over the next decade. The majority of these cuts will come from work-reporting requirements, increasing barriers for enrollment and renewal of Medicaid coverage, and limiting states’ ability to raise state Medicaid funds through provider taxes. The century-long border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia is one of various conflicts Trump claims to have resolved. Trump presided over the signing of a ceasefire deal between the two sides in October, calling it “a monumental step”. He had pressured leaders from both countries to make a deal by warning trade talks with the US would otherwise be put on hold. However, the underlying causes of the conflict, which is rooted in longstanding disagreements over colonial-era maps, has never been resolved. The ceasefire broke down just weeks later in November, and fighting erupted again in December, forcing half a million people to flee their homes. Both sides have repeatedly accused each other of provocations. On Tuesday, Thailand’s military said its troops exchanged fire with Cambodian forces, accusing its neighbour of first firing “a single 40mm grenade round” near a Thai patrol in the border province of Sisaket. Cambodia has denied this. Cambodia has accused Thai forces of occupying Cambodian territory, saying Thai troops have laid shipping containers in a way that prevents its citizens from returning to their villages. Thailand denies this, saying the land belongs to Thailand. Earlier, the president said that crime in Washington DC was now “at the lowest level ever recorded” and that murders in DC this January “were down close to 100%” from a year ago. However, data from the Metropolitan police deparment (MPD) shows that homicides are down 67% compared with this time in 2025. While violent crime in DC fell in 2025, it had started to fall in the year before Trump took office, sent national guard troops to the nation’s capital and federalized the MPD. Former Trump press secretary Stephanie Grisham, speaking at the State of the Swamp counter-event at the National Press Club, drew on her time inside the first Trump administration to call him a liar mid-State of the Union speech. “He used to tell me: ‘Stephanie, if you tell them enough, they will believe it,’” she told the crowd, after his speech was turned off. “I can tell you, he is lying right now to this country,” she added. Grisham left the administration in 2021 and has since become one of Trump’s most outspoken critics. The Virginia governor wrapped her speech in 12 minutes, ending her remarks hopeful that her success is indicative of more Democratic wins come November: I was the first Democrat elected in 50 years, swinging our district 17 points. Those who are stepping up now to run will win in November, because Americans, you at home, know you can demand more and that we are working to lower cost. We are working to keep our communities and our country safe, and we are working for you. Spanberger’s gubernatorial victory last year was a bright spot for Democrats as they reckoned with Kamala Harris’s 2024 election loss. “I won my election by 15 points, and we won 13 new seats in our state legislature because voters decided they wanted something different,” Spanberger said in her address today, telegraphing a blue wave in the upcoming midterms. “This is happening across the country. New Jersey elected Mikey Sherrill as governor in a double-digit victory,” the Virginia governor added. “Democrats flip state legislative seats in places like Georgia, Iowa, Mississippi and Texas. The list goes on and on. Ordinary Americans are stepping up to run in the spirit of our forefathers. They are running to demand more and to do more for their neighbors and communities.” The Virginia governor went on to admonish the Trump administration for the violent immigration crackdown throughout the country – particularly in Minnesota. “They have sent children, a little boy in a blue bunny hat, children to far-off detention centers,” Spanberger said of Liam Conejo Ramos, the five-year-old who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents in Minneapolis. “They have killed American citizens in our streets,” Spanberger added, referring to the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers. “They have done it all with their faces masked from accountability … Our broken immigration system is something to be fixed, not an excuse for unaccountable agents to terrorize our communities.” In her opening remarks, Spanberger is homing in on how Trump’s economic policy is affecting Americans at large. “Since this president took office last year, his reckless trade policies have forced American families to pay more than $1,700 each in tariff costs,” Spanberger said of an estimate from congressional Democrats. “Small businesses have suffered. Farmers have suffered, some losing entire markets every day. Americans are paying the price,” she added, while noting that Republican members of Congress “remain unwilling to assert their constitutional authority to stop him [Trump]. They’re making your life harder. They’re making your life more expensive.” Abigail Spanberger, Virginia’s Democratic governor, is now delivering the party’s response to Trump’s State of the Union address. She kicked off her remarks focused on the economy: Let me ask you, the American people watching at home, three questions: is the president working to make life more affordable for you and your family? Is the president working to keep Americans safe, both at home and abroad? Is the president working for you? During his State of the Union address, Trump suggested that energy prices were decreasing. “When they see energy going down to numbers like that, they cannot believe it,” he said. But the average household energy bill went up by 6.7% from 2024 to 2025 in the US, my colleague Oliver Milman and I found last month. That’s despite Trump’s oft-repeated promise to cut electricity costs in half within his first year back in office. Since Trump retook the White House, utility companies have raised or sought to raise rates on American families by at least $92bn, raising bills for 112 million electric customers and 52 million gas customers, according to an analysis from liberal thinktank the Center for American Progress. The president’s attacks on clean energy expansion are also expected to increase electricity rates by up to 18% by 2035, data from power research group Energy Innovation shows. The Trump administration has also gutted energy assistance for US families. Last year, the administration eliminated tax credits for cost-cutting home energy-efficiency upgrades. It also attempted to eliminate the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps 6 million low-income Americans with their energy bills each year; the program survived, but has been significantly hindered after the administration laid off the program’s entire staff. The cuts and a government shutdown caused unprecedented delays in the disbursement of aid. Reporting from Washington When it comes to foreign policy in Donald Trump’s address, the newsiest bit was the president claiming that Iran was developing missiles that could threaten the United States. “They’ve already developed missiles that can threaten Europe and our bases overseas,” he said. “And they’re working to build missiles that will soon reach the United States of America.” Trump did not provide any more information on those weapons systems. The president is seeking to broaden negotiations from just Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon to its ballistic missiles program and its support for overseas proxies as well. Iran’s deputy foreign minister today reaffirmed that Tehran would only negotiate over the country’s nuclear program, leaving negotiations in something of a dead end before the next round of talks in Geneva on Thursday. “We are in negotiations with them,” he continued. “They want to make a deal. But we haven’t heard those secret words: ‘we will never have a nuclear weapon’.” The president broke the record for the longest State of the Union address since the American Presidency Project began recording addresses in 1964. Trump’s speech came in at 108 minutes. As expected, Trump announced new “ratepayer protection pledges” during the State of the Union address, claiming they will protect Americans from rising electricity costs driven by increased demand from AI datacenters. “We’re telling the major tech companies that they have the obligation to provide for their own power needs,” he said. “No one’s prices will go up, and in many cases, prices of electricity will go down for communities.” The president reportedly negotiated these plans with tech giants for them to pay for increased electricity costs in locations where new datacenters are being erected. Amid bipartisan pressure before midterm elections later this year, Microsoft last month released a plan it said will cut consumer energy costs. Tech firm Anthropic issued a similar pledge this month. Green groups are largely unimpressed with Trump’s “ratepayer protection pledges” plan. “Trump’s datacenter announcement is a toothless, empty promise based on backroom deals with his own billionaire donors,” said Jesse Lee, a senior adviser at the climate advocacy non-profit Climate Power. He noted that though Trump pledged to halve utility bills within his first year back in office, they have instead gone up nationwide. A new poll from Lee’s group and Blue Rose Research found that voters are deeply concerned about datacenters’ effect on energy consumption and energy costs. When participants were asked to pick the more concerning issue in randomly paired matchups, they selected utility costs 64% of the time and energy consumption 59% of the time. Ari Matusiak, the CEO of pro-electrification and climate non-profit Rewiring America, said the ratepayer protection pledges are “a good start” to take on that issue, but don’t go far enough. “They’re not enforceable, and tech companies don’t set electricity rates. Utilities and regulators do,” he said in a statement. “The way to earn trust is to make investments families can actually see and feel. That means investing not just in power plants but in people’s homes, freeing up grid capacity while helping families lower their energy bills.” Energy demand fromdata centers in the US is expected to increase up to threefold from 2023 to 2028, and by the end of that time frame could consume enough electricity annually to power more than 28m American households, an analysis from progressive environmental group Food and Water Watch found. More than an hour and a half into his State of the Union address, the president has finally mentioned the escalating tensions with Iran, as the world awaits with baited breath the US’s next move. “My preference is to solve this problem through diplomacy. But one thing is certain, I will never allow the world’s No 1 sponsor of terror, which they are by far, to have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said. Earlier, the president repeated his misleading and exaggerated claim that he’s “solved eight wars”. In response, Michigan representative Rashida Tlaib, a Democrat, shouted: “It’s a lie”. My colleague, Joseph Gedeon, debunked this often-repeated statement from Trump earlier this year. When Trump introduced the mother of Iryna Zarutska – the Ukrainian woman murdered on a train in Charlotte, North Carolina – he falsely claimed the man who stabbed her was “a hardened criminal set free to kill in America [who] came in through open borders”. However, Decarlos Brown Jr, the man arrested for killing Zarutska, was not an immigrant. According to local reports he was born and raised in North Caolina. Trump has long insisted that non-citizens are responsible for violent crime throughout the US. Data shows that relative to undocumented immigrants, US-born citizens are more than twice as likely to be arrested for violent crimes, and 2.5 times more likely to be arrested for drug crimes. Trump introduced Sage Blair, a Virginia teenager whom the president claimed school officials “socially transition[ed] … to a new agenda, treating her as a boy and hiding it from her parents”. The president said that Sage is now living as “a proud and wonderful young woman with a full-ride scholarship to Liberty University”. As the president continued his well-trodden rant against gender-affirming care, Democrats looked on in disapproval, while many Republicans cheered. “These people are crazy. I’m telling you, they’re crazy,” Trump said of Democrats. Trump sparred with Democrats when he asked all lawmakers to stand if they agreed that “the first duty of the American government is to protect American citizens, not illegal aliens” and restore funding to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which remains shuttered. It was a clear opportunity to chide lawmakers on the left, while Republican lawmakers stood with gusto. “You should be ashamed of yourself for not standing up,” Trump told Democrats, as several shouted back in response. “You’ve killed Americans,” Ilhan Omar said, as the president managed to provide his first visual example of the chasm in Congress. The president repeated his xenophobic comments that the “Somali pirates ransacked Minnesota” through “bribery, corruption and lawlessness” during his speech. “Importing these cultures through unrestricted immigration and open borders brings those problems right here to the USA,” Trump added. Democratic representative Ilhan Omar from Minnesota called the president a “liar” from her seat in the audience. Trump said that the administration’s “war on fraud” would now be led by his vice-president, JD Vance. Reporters in the House chamber are noting that Democratic representative Lauren Underwood, of Illinois, appears to have walked out of the president’s State of the Union address. Trump said what congressional Republicans have been wanting him to emphasize before the midterm elections: the tax cuts they enacted last year through his massive policy legislation. The president said the One Big Beautiful Bill Act brought the “largest tax cuts” in history, which is not accurate because they’re actually the sixth-largest, according to the Tax Foundation, and this messaging does not appear to have really broken through. As we expected, the president bemoaned the supreme court’s ruling that Trump exceeded his presidential authority by implementing many global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. “I used these tariffs, took in hundreds of billions of dollars, to make great deals for our country, both economically and on a national security basis, everything was working well,” Trump said. “They were ripping us so badly. You all know that. Everybody knows that, even the Democrats know it.” The president called the supreme court’s ruling “unfortunate”, as the four justices attending today’s address sat directly in the president’s eyeline. While Trump falsely claimed the tariffs led to “no inflation” and “tremendous growth”, he said Friday’s decision was “disappointing”. However, the president went on to tout his new 15% global tariffs under section 122 of the Trade Act. “They’re a little more complex, but they’re actually probably better, leading to a solution that will be even stronger than before,” he said. Trump incorrectly said that these duties won’t require congressional oversight; however, these tariffs can only last 150 days before Congress has to agree to extend them. Trump has touted his “drill, baby drill” agenda at the State of the Union address. “American oil production is up by more than 600,000 barrels a day,” he said. “American natural gas production is at an all-time high because I kept my promise to drill, baby, drill.” Since re-entering office, Trump has worked to boost fossil fuels and roll back dozens upon dozens of environmental policies and incentives. Data shows that agenda has not worked out for the fossil fuel workers Trump claims to protect, one advocate noted on social media. “Since President Trump took office, the drive to achieve energy dominance has resulted in the loss of 15,000 mining, oil, and natural gas jobs,” Sean O’Leary, a senior researcher at the Appalachia-focused clean energy and jobs thinktank Ohio River Valley Institute, wrote on social media, citing US Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Trump touted low gas prices during his state of the union speech, saying they are “now below $2.30 a gallon in most states and in some places, $1.99 a gallon”. But a major environmental rollback his administration enacted two weeks ago could push gas prices up. The repeal of the endangerment finding – the legal underpinning for all greenhouse gas regulations in the US – is expected to create a rise in gas prices, as I explained in an analysis last week. That’s according to the administration’s own data. Check it out here. Trump is spending a lot of time boasting about sports accomplishments in a way that he does at rallies. He just announced that the US men’s Olympic hockey team goaltender Connor Hellebuyck, who played a key role in their gold medal win against Canada, will receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Reporting from the House chamber When Trump began his address, everyone in the chamber sat down except for the representative Al Green, who continued to brandish his sign – which read “Black people aren’t apes!”, a reference to the US president recently sharing a racist video depiction of Barack and Michelle Obama. Then a man came over – perhaps from security – and senator Markwayne Mullin again approached Green menacingly. Green decided to leave. As he walked up the aisle, clutching his walking stick and protest sign, there were some acrimonious exchanges with Republicans, a few of whom began chanting: “USA! USA!” Green’s seat is now empty save for a handwritten cardboard sign that says: “Al Green.” This is some extraordinary choreography organized by Trump: he introduced the US men’s Olympic team, who entered the House chamber on the steps of the press gallery. “Here with us tonight is a group of winners who just made the entire nation proud,” Trump said, before the Olympians appeared, raising their gold medals to raucous applause. Trump says the US women’s Olympic hockey team will soon be coming to the White House. It’s unclear whether something has changed since the team earlier declined an invitation this morning citing scheduling conflicts. Before introducing the team, Trump said: “Our country is winning again. In fact, we’re winning so much that we really don’t know what to do about it. People are asking me, please, please, please, Mr President, we’re winning too much. We can’t take it anymore.” Trump’s first mention of foreign policy is with Venezuela, which he calls “our new friend and partner” and boasts the US has gotten 80m barrels of oil from the country. This comes after the ouster of Venezuela’s deposed leader, Nicolás Maduro. While Trump touted the plummeting border crossings, he noted that “we will always allow people to come in legally”. However, his administration has worked to weaken legal pathways to live and work in the US, including scrapping Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for several countries. Democratic representative Al Green, who was reprimanded for interrupting Trump’s address last year, was just ejected from the House chamber. My colleague, David Smith, is at the Capitol and notes that Green held up a handwritten sign that says: “Black people aren’t apes!” A Republican tried to make him put it down but Green refused. Senator Markwayne Mullin walked over and tried to stop Green before the pair had a brief argument. Off the bat, the president has branded the US as “back”. “Bigger, better, richer and stronger than ever before,” Trump said. “This is the golden age of America.” He went on to disparage the Biden presidency, noting that he inherited “a nation in crisis”, but noted that his administration has “achieved a transformation like no one has ever seen before”. “It is indeed a turnaround for the ages,” he added. Chants of “USA, USA” erupted ahead of the president speaking in the House chamber. Donald Trump has just entered the House chamber to deliver his State of the Union address. He’s shaking many attendees’ hands, listening to their messages as he walks to the podium. Some lawmakers are posing for selfies with Trump. He just shook hands with the supreme court justices in attendance tonight, including Amy Coney Barrett. On Friday, Trump said that Barrett’s family should be “ashamed” of her concurring opinion to invalidate many of the president’s tariffs. First lady Melania Trump just walked into the House chamber to some applause. She’s followed by members of Trump’s cabinet and White House team. Many of the president’s family, including daughter Ivanka Trump, are already seated for his address. Four supreme court justices – John Roberts, Elena Kagan, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – are in the House chamber tonight. This comes just days after the court ruled that many of Trump’s global tariffs are illegal. Donald Trump has arrived at the US Capitol, where he’s set to address a joint session of Congress in a few minutes. We’ll bring you the latest as it happens. A reminder that the president’s address takes place against the backdrop of an ongoing Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shutdown. Following the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis by federal immigration agents, during the administration’s crackdown in Minnesota, Democratic lawmakers decried tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Now, members of Congress are at an impasse as they hammer out guardrails for greater oversight of both agencies. The crowd chanted “Abolish ICE! Abolish ICE!” as senator Chris Murphy introduced his guest, Afghan refugee and immigrant advocate Fereshteh Ganjavi. Murphy explained he wasn’t at the State of the Union address because “these are not normal times, and Democrats have to stop behaving normally”. Moments later, a Trump supporter pushed through the barricades on the grounds and confronted Murphy. An organizer pulled the heckler off the stage as the crowd booed. Host Joy Reid addressed the interruption. “Attention all Maga trolls: Your bullshit is not welcome here,” she said. “We are here to hear the truth and to hear from impacted people.” On the National Mall, hundreds of people, including about 30 Democratic members of Congress, are gathered for the “People’s State of the Union,” a counter rally to protest President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. Attendees held signs that read “No Money for ICE” and “Healthcare Not Warfare”. One person on stage carried a large poster with the photographs of the more than 30 people who were killed in dealings with ICE since Trump took office in 2025. The event kicked off about an hour before the president’s speech is scheduled to begin. MoveOn’s executive director Katie Bethell, who helped organize the event, told attendees they organized the boycott, “because we know that Donald Trump’s State of the Union will bear no resemblance to what’s actually happening in this country today”. Mike Johnson just gavelled the House into session, as lawmakers funnelled into the chamber. Vice-president JD Vance is walking to his seat as he greets guests, members of Congress and officials. The president is on the move. Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump have left the White House for the US Capitol. It’s just a 2 mile drive through Washington DC. Republican House speaker Mike Johnson has arrived for Trump’s State of the Union address. He’ll be seated next to the president as he speaks, alongside the vice-president, JD Vance. During his State of the Union speech tonight, Trump is expected to roll out a “ratepayer protection pledges” plan, which the White House says will shield Americans from electricity price spikes driven by increased demand from AI datacenters. Trump reportedly negotiated the plans with tech giants, who have agreed to pay for increased electricity costs in locations where new datacenters are being erected. But green groups are skeptical that they will effectively lower bills. “Let’s be honest: big tech isn’t going to do anything for the benefit of anyone but itself,” said Mitch Jones, managing director of policy and litigation at progressive environmental group Food and Water Watch. The president promised to halve electricity costs within his first year back in office, but the average US household paid nearly $116 more for electricity in 2025 than the year before, a 6.7% increase, the Guardian found last month. In communities near datacenters, electricity prices increased even more – by as much as 267% compared with five years ago, a Bloomberg analysis found last year. The real solution, Jones said, is to place a pause on AI expansion. “With the Trump administration’s complete unwillingness to hold corporations accountable for any number of harmful impacts on society, it’s imperative we halt new datacenter construction now,” he said. “We must take the time to truly study the full range of impacts of datacenters on our local communities – most certainly including the skyrocketing electricity rates already being thrust on families and small businesses – before determining not how, but if this industry can operate in a responsible way. “This is a big ‘if’, and right now no one – literally no one – knows if it is possible.” We’re now seeing pictures of Donald Trump’s cabinet arriving at the US Capitol before the president’s State of the Union address. They’re walking through Statuary Hall and into the House chamber, where Trump will speak. Just hours before the State of the Union address, the mood inside the National Press Club for one of the capital’s bigger counter-events is restless and defiant. “I got into DC a few hours ago and got to this event just minutes ago,” Minneapolis mayor Jacob Frey told the Guardian. “It’s full of people trying to stand up for democracy right now – angry about the trajectory of where our nation is going. They’re frustrated by the lack of abiding to the United States constitution.” Frey, who will be making a rebuttal tonight, gestured to the range of anxieties animating the ballroom: abortion rights, international tensions with Iran, environmental protections. Hundreds of people are at the event, which is just getting under way. In 2025, when Trump made a joint address to Congress, he spoke at length about his efforts to cut the size of the federal workforce, change US foreign policy and implement a risky trade agenda, which included massive tariffs. In the speech lasting an hour and 40 minutes – the longest in US history – he also pointed to executive orders and actions implemented in the first weeks of his second term. This year, despite facing opinion polls showing growing disapproval on a range of issues, it’s likely Trump will continue to insist he is “making America great again”. Expect the president to address issues of tariffs, which were struck down by the supreme court last week and then implemented again this weekend, alongside a range of other issues including immigration and foreign policy. This year’s address could also run long. According to the official White House schedule, he is not expected to return to the White House until 11.30pm. A reminder that major news networks will broadcast Trump’s address live. CBS will broadcast a livestream on its YouTube page, as will PBS. The Guardian will have a live feed of the address to Congress and our team of reporters will be covering and factchecking the president’s speech. As we noted earlier, Trump’s last address to Congress was the longest in recent history. The second-longest was Bill Clinton in 2000, who spoke for 89 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project. The former Democratic president also holds third-place for his State of the Union address in 1995, which lasted 85 minutes. Trump, however, claims the remaining spots in the top five. His addresses in 2019 and 2018 ran for 82 and 81 minutes, respectively. Erika Kirk, the widow of the late conservative activist Charlie Kirk, will attend tonight’s State of the Union address as a special guest of the president. After her husband was assassinated at a college event for his non-profit Turning Point USA, Erika Kirk took over the organization. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president would call on Congress to “firmly reject political violence against our fellow citizens” with Kirk as a guest. Senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, criticized fellow Democrats who are planning to boycott Donald Trump’s State of the Union address tonight, a decision party leaders have left up to individuals. Klobuchar told reporters on Capitol Hill earlier: If he’s coming to our house, you got to be there. Otherwise, you let him own the house. At least a dozen Democrats are planning to skip the address tonight and attend a rally organized by progressive advocacy groups on the National Mall instead. The Democratic senator Mark Kelly also confirmed to reporters that he plans to attend the State of the Union later. Kelly said that Trump wants to see him “sitting in prison right now”, after the president branded the Arizona lawmaker “seditious” for taking part in a video where several Democratic members of Congress urged members of the military to defy illegal orders. Earlier this month, a grand jury in Washington DC declined to indict the six members of Congress featured in the video: Kelly, Michigan senator Elissa Slotkin and House members Jason Crow of Colorado, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania. Elizabeth Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, said she would be at the president’s State of the Union address tonight. “I think it’s important to do. And I will be there. And I will be there as he tries to put a spin on this economy,” she told CNN. “He can spin it however he wants, but the Trump economy works great for billionaires and is not working for American families, and American families know that.” The Massachusetts senator will be joined by Dr Geralde Gabeau, who leads the Boston-based Immigrant Family Services Institute Inc (IFSI), which works to support immigrant communities and protect immigrants’ rights. Warren noted that Trump’s immigration crackdown across the country, as well as the actions of federal immigration enforcement agents, are “making all of us less safe”. “Dr Gabeau’s work makes our communities stronger, and I’m proud to have her by my side,” Warren added. We’re expecting to see at least some of the supreme court’s nine members at this evening’s address. This comes just days after the court ruled that many of Donald Trump’s global tariffs are illegal. In a 6-3 decision, the court held that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) – a 1977 statute that grants the president authority to regulate or prohibit certain international transactions during a national emergency – does not authorize Donald Trump to unilaterally impose tariffs. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Brett Kavanaugh dissented. After Friday’s ruling, the president was incensed and vented his frustration during an impromptu press conference. Trump said he was “ashamed” of the justices who ruled against his use of IEEPA. He hurled insults at them while speaking to reporters, calling them “fools and lap dogs” and “very unpatriotic and disloyal to our constitution” and even made baseless claims that they were being swayed by “foreign interests”. He also said that the justices were “barely” invited to his State of the Union address. “Honestly, I couldn’t care less if they come,” the president told reporters. Notably, Trump didn’t say whether he regretted nominating Neil Gorsuch or Amy Coney Barrett to the supreme court, after they concurred with liberal justices on the bench. “I think the decision was terrible,” Trump said. “I think it’s an embarrassment to their families, if you want to know the truth, the two of them.” By contrast, Trump praised the justices who broke from the rest of the bench. “I’m so proud of him,” the president said of Kavanaugh, whom he nominated in his first term, while lauding the judge’s “genius and his great ability”. The president highlighted Kavanaugh’s dissenting opinion, which argued that other legal pathways remain for a president to impose tariffs. Trump announced that he plans to pursue some of those options. Many Democratic members of Congress have invited several of Jeffrey Epstein’s survivors to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address. The House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries announced that one of his guests tonight is Marina Lacerda, who said that she was groomed and abused by Jeffrey Epstein when she was a teenager. Jeffries’s counterpart, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, has invited Dani Bensky, who said she met Epstein when she was 17. “Dani has turned unimaginable pain into unrelenting advocacy,” Schumer said. “Survivors deserve justice. Trump must end the cover‑up and release the full Epstein files – NOW.” While several Democrats are skipping the address, many are attending with survivors to intensify their calls for the justice department to release additional documents related to Epstein, after the latest tranche of files did little to quiet frustration with the Trump administration. Ro Khanna, the Democratic representative who co‑authored legislation compelling the justice department to release the Epstein files, will bring another survivor, Haley Robson, who has said she was trafficked by Epstein at age 16. In a statement, the 52-year-old senator said he planned to discuss “a federal government that weaponizes enforcement agencies against immigrants and US citizens alike”, as well as the Trump administration’s “failed economic agenda” and its effort to restrict voting access. “Americans don’t need another speech from Donald Trump pretending everything is fine when their bills are too high, paychecks are too low, and masked and militarized federal agents are roaming our communities violating constitutional rights on a daily basis,” Padilla said in a statement. Padilla, the son of Mexican immigrants and the first Latino to represent California in the Senate, was tackled to the ground by federal agents and handcuffed after attempting to ask the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, a question at a news conference in Los Angeles during the administration’s immigration crackdown in the city last summer. Virginia’s governor, Abigail Spanberger, will deliver the Democratic response to Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, after tonight’s speech wraps up. Spanberger, a former undercover CIA officer who served three terms in Congress, became Virginia’s first female governor earlier this year, resoundingly winning an office previously held by a Republican. She won the race by a double-digit margin, campaigning on affordability and lowering costs for families. Spanberger said she plans to use her rebuttal to address Americans’ concerns with “rising costs, chaos in their communities, and a real fear of what each day might bring”. “I look forward to laying out what these Americans expect and deserve – leaders who are working hard to deliver for them,” she added. In choosing Spanberger, 46, Democratic leaders are handing the spotlight to a battleground-tested moderate with national security credentials and a reputation for message discipline, particularly on economic issues and highlighting the impact of federal policies on everyday Virginians. Her 15-point victory in a purple state last November, alongside Mikie Sherrill in the New Jersey’s governor’s race, provided a jolt of optimism for Democrats still searching for an effective response to counter a president who dominates the national political conversation. Several Democratic lawmakers will boycott Donald Trump’s State of the Union address tonight. Instead, many will rally on the National Mall. So far, at least 30 Democratic members of Congress have said they will skip the State of the Union. These include senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and Adam Schiff of California, as well as progressive representatives Pramila Jayapal, Maxwell Frost and Greg Casar. The event, dubbed the “People’s State of the Union”, is being coordinated by progressive media network MeidasTouch and the liberal advocacy group MoveOn. Attorney and commentator Katie Phang and former anchor Joy Reid will co-host the rally. The event’s organizers say it will spotlight federal workers, immigrants and Americans affected by the Trump administration’s policies. In a statement, Van Hollen said that he would not attend the address. “Trump is marching America towards fascism, and I refuse to normalize his shredding of our Constitution &amp; democracy,” he said. “This cannot be business as usual.” My colleagues will be covering the latest developments from the counter-protests. Welcome to our live coverage of Donald Trump’s first State of the Union address of his second term. We’ll bring you the very latest from Washington and beyond, as my colleagues and I cover the main event, the counter-programming and the responses to the president’s speech. Trump telegraphed that he’s not particularly concerned about the length of tonight’s address, which will begin at 9pm ET. “It’s going to be a long speech because we have so much to talk about,” he told reporters at a White House event on Monday. Last year, the president spoke for a record-breaking 100 minutes. As that was Trump’s first year back in office, it was considered an address to a joint session of Congress, as opposed to a State of the Union speech. This year’s address doubles as his pitch to voters to keep Republicans in control of both chambers. Trump’s frequent press appearances mean that we’re expecting many of his greatest hits, as he touts what he sees as the primary achievements of his second administration. We can expect to hear several jabs about Joe Biden’s presidency, mass deportation numbers, the state of the economy, the president’s perceived diplomatic victories and the number of “wars” he’s settled. Throughout the night, we’ll also be factchecking the president’s comments. Earlier, top Democrats predicted Trump’s speech would be “long, painful and tedious”. At a press conference on Capitol Hill, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer slammed Trump’s address, just hours before it was set to begin. “Never in our lifetime have we gone into a State of the Union where the president’s rhetoric and the country’s reality are so far apart,” Schumer said."
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:32:49Z,"Nvidia fails to impress investors with blockbuster results; Ocado cutting 1,000 jobs – business live","Job cut announcements often thrill the City, pushing up a company’s share price. Ocado, though, have dropped by almost 10% in early trading. Investors clearly aren’t impressed by today’s financial results, which show that cash flow was still negative, despite a 12% rise in revenues. Ocado says its core priority is to turn cash flow positive during the current financial year. The firm, which sells automated warehouse technology, recently suffered a blow when its US partner, Kroger, announced the closure of three warehouses using Ocado’s high-tech equipment. Canadian partner Sobeys is also closing a warehouse that uses Ocado’s robots and automation technology. At 215p this morning, Ocado’s shares aren’t much above the the 180p price at which it debuted on the London stock market in 2010. Back in 2020, amid the pandemic boom in deliveries, they rose over £26. Online grocery firm Ocado is planning to cut around 1,000 jobs as it cuts costs and uses artificial intelligence systems to become more efficient. Ocado has announced that it expects to slash £150m of its technology spend and support costs, partly through “AI efficiencies, and associated reductions and cost discipline in Support functions”. According to PA Media, around 1,000 jobs are being axed, or around 5% of Ocado’s global workforce, with about two thirds of the job losses impacting its UK operations. Tim Steiner, CEO of Ocado Group, said this morning that Ocado has largely finished a “very significant” investment phase in its robotics and automation capabilities, and would now focus its R&amp;D investment on areas with the clearest path to value creation. Steiner added: These changes will also reflect the lower structural cost base that we have signalled over recent years. Regrettably, this means a significant number of roles will no longer be required. We are grateful to colleagues who are affected by these changes, and whose talent and hard work have made a lasting contribution to Ocado. We will support those impacted through this process. Richard Clode, portfolio manager at the Global Technology Leaders Team of Janus Henderson Investors, explains how the debate over Nvidia’s value has shifted in recen months: “Nvidia’s stock has derated materially over the past six months, with the share price stagnating despite 50% positive earnings revisions. As a result, the debate has shifted away from near-term results and toward the sustainability of AI capex spending, amid concerns around its quantum, monetisation and potential cashflow degradation. The muted reaction to Nvidia’s blowout guidance mirrored last quarter and reflects this ongoing debate. Whether Jensen can move the conversation forward at next month’s GTC event remains to be seen, but in the interim, despite broader market concerns about an AI bubble and elevated technology valuations, Nvidia continues to derate. It now trades at a significant discount to AI peers and on a similar multiple to McDonald’s.” “Uncertainty continues, both on the trade front and the geopolitical front,” the chief economist of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) Beata Javorcik warned with some understatement, as she launched the London-based lender’s latest forecasts (released here this morning). The taxpayer-backed EBRD once focused on rebuilding central and Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, but now extends its reach into the Balkans, Africa and even Iraq. Javorcik said the countries in which it operates had been more resilient in the face of volatile US trade policy than expected, forecasting GDP growth of 3.6% this year, up from the 3.4% expected in September. She said: “Economies across the EBRD regions are proving more adaptable in the face of persistent trade tensions than many expected. “Supply chains are evolving rather than retreating, creating new opportunities for diversification and integration into emerging industries, including those linked to AI.” However, she suggested the full impact of tariffs may not yet have been felt, because of significant front-loading of imports ahead of their imposition last year. The EBRD’s analysis also underlined the hefty debt burden faced by some economies - which could make them vulnerable if global credit conditions tightened. “Government interest payments reached 89% of government revenues in Egypt in 2025 and are estimated to account for over 30% of revenues in Kenya, and over 20% in Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and Jordan,” it said. Traders in Tokyo should start ordering their “Nikkei 60,000” hats! Japan’s Nikkei share index has closed at a record high, as software-related stocks surged today, shrugging off recent losses. This pushed the Nikkei over the 59,000-point mark for the first time, hitting 59,332 points at one stage before ending the day at 58,753 points, an all-time closing high. Yutaka Miura, senior technical analyst at Mizuho Securities, says: “Since it was widely expected that NVIDIA would post strong results, and it did, this has prompted some profit-taking for the moment.” Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote, says Nvidia announced “another spectacular set of results” last night: The company posted $68.1bn in revenue, 73% higher than the same period last year, with 90% of that coming from its data-center division. Net income almost doubled, and gross margin improved to 75% — all significantly better than analysts had expected. Addressing concerns that Google’s TPUs — designed for AI inference, far more energy-efficient and cheaper than Nvidia’s — could steal business, Jensen Huang said that his company is “the king of inference today” and that the Blackwell and next-generation Vera Rubin platforms “will extend that leadership further”, adding that adoption of agentic AI is skyrocketing. Although his words may sound over-the-top, Huang has delivered consistently on his promises over the past three years. Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of business, the financial markets and the world economy. What’s a tech firm gotta do to get a share price bump these days? Nvidia may be asking that question after reporting strong earnings last night, alongside a solid growth forecast, only to receive a shrug from Wall Street. The chip-making firm certainly had another extremely strong quarter – it posted record quarterly revenue of $68.1bn for October-December 2025, up 20% compared with the third quarter of last year and a sizzling 73% more than a year earlier. The company said sales were being driven by accelerated computing and AI, with customers scrambling to get their hands on its high-powered Blackwell chip. Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, told investors that take-up of AI agents by companies was accelerating: “Enterprise adoption of agents is skyrocketing. Our customers are racing to invest in AI compute — the factories powering the AI industrial revolution and their future growth.” Nvidia also predicted another jump in sales in the current quarter, when revenue is expected to rise to $78.0bn, beating forecasts. But while its shares did briefly rally in after-hours trading when the results hit the wires, this didn’t last – the stock then turned negative, and finally finished just 0.2% higher. As Jim Reid of Deutsche Bank puts it: The initially positive reaction faded as the company’s conference call offered limited detail on the revenue outlook, leaving the chipmaker’s shares little changed by the end of extended trading. So perhaps a sign of investors’ increased anxiety over AI valuations. Nvidia’s problem is partly that its share are already ‘priced for perfection’ – up 1,300% over the last five years. So even stellar sales growth is already priced in. Also, these results landed in a market where investors are fretting that AI will drive up white-collar unemployment, take business away from software-as-a-service companies, payment providers and travel and estate agencies, and trigger a mortgage crash. Kathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, says there are a few factors behind the muted reaction to what she calls “Nvidia’s A* earnings report”: Nvidia and the semiconductor space has outperformed the broader tech sector so far this year. Nvidia’s results suggest that demand for AI is strong, and fears of an AI bubble are overdone. Thus, investors could pile into the less loved parts of tech, for example software, before going headfirst into Nvidia. The Nasdaq e-mini contract is higher by 1.4% after Nvidia’s earnings report. Secondly, this report did not generate much reason for disappointment, but even so, some investors may have hoped that CEO Jensen Huang would boost sales pipeline estimates for this year above $500bn. Huang was also asked about hyperscalers’ and their future capex plans now that there was some pressure on their cash flows. This did not bother Huang, but it could sow a seed of doubt in the mind of investors. Overall, the initial reaction to Nvidia’s results suggest that investors are still unwilling to chase a higher trend in tech stocks right now, even after Nvidia’s stunning earnings report. This report will likely be pored over in detail on Thursday, but for now it is not driving a significant rally in the share price.

2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:26:45Z,Palestinian solidarity in Britain ‘being silenced and criminalised’,"Palestinian solidarity is being “silenced, criminalised and sanctioned”, according to an advocacy group that says it has recorded more than 900 examples of repression across Britain in the last six years. People who have been targeted have suffered smears, disinformation, harassment, doxing (having private or identifying information published online), visa cancellations, financial blacklisting, loss of employment and arrest, according to the European Legal Support Center, which along with the research group Forensic Architecture has created the “index of repression”. The ELSC said such consequences have been justified by allegations of antisemitism or support for terrorism with the main “actors of repression” being police (220 incidents) followed by educational institutions (192), pro-Israel advocacy groups (141) and journalists and other media actors (141). At a press conference on Wednesday, Bob Trafford, of Forensic Architecture, said: “The data, painstakingly gathered and verified by ELSC, reveals the operation of a system, not something which is centrally directed, of course but something which is organic, multipolar, self-reinforcing and mutually exacerbating. “A system which seeks to raise intolerably the personal cost to any individual who speaks or acts in light of their conscience … seeks to reduce civil society’s capacity to call out genocide and to demand at the same time robust action by our governments.” Students, academics and teachers, (336) appear most frequently on the index as targets of repression, followed by activists and organisers (229 incidents). The report says they are often targeted in different ways with artists and cultural workers (71 incidents) often having events cancelled. The press conference heard from Sajja Iqbal, a teacher and member of Redbridge Palestine Solidarity Campaign, who lost her job after she went into a local Sainsbury’s and removed Israeli goods from the shelves, put them in a shopping trolley and covered it with a Palestinian flag. The protesters also handed in a letter to the store manager explaining their actions and calling for the supermarket to boycott such goods. She said her name and school were plastered across the press, affecting her physical and mental health. “This is what they do to silence me and all the workers that speak out,” said Iqbal. “I have not committed any criminal offence but simply exercised my democratic right.” She intends to take legal action with the help of ELSC. The advocacy group said it had not individually assessed each case in the index. Tara Mariwany, the senior monitoring officer at ELSC, said: “It is not our role to decide what is and what isn’t antisemitism or support for terrorism or any of the other allegations you’ll find in the database. It’s simply our role to document it and to show that it doesn’t matter if you wear a watermelon sticker on your shirt, that might give rise to the allegation of antisemitism. “It’s simply about showing the scale of it and that should give enough of a cause to question the allegation itself and question the smearing itself. We ourselves don’t decide what is and what isn’t fitting within a category.”"
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:23:38Z,Home Office denies ‘absurd’ criticism over rule change that could leave dual nationals stranded,"The Home Office has dismissed as “absurd” claims that it failed to properly communicate new border rules that left some British dual nationals at risk of being denied boarding flights to the UK. During a heated session in parliament on Wednesday, the Home Office minister Mike Tapp suggested that media coverage in the Guardian and BBC reflected the department’s efforts to publicise the changes. The Labour backbencher Kerry McCarthy described how two of her constituents feared being stranded on their honeymoon because of the new requirements, which came into force on Wednesday. Under the changes, British dual nationals must present a valid or expired British passport, or a £589 certificate of entitlement, to prove their right of abode before boarding a plane, ferry or train to the UK. “They don’t know if they can actually get back into the UK from [their] honeymoon,” McCarthy said. The Conservative MP Alicia Kearns said the policy was justified but urged Tapp to “commit, however, to improve the communications plan, which has been insufficient”. Tapp rejected calls for a grace period but said he would host a drop-in session with MPs next Monday to discuss individual cases. He added that consular services were available overseas to help stranded Britons, and dual nationals would obtain a passport within four weeks – and in some cases nine days. The Liberal Democrats’ immigration spokesperson, Will Forster, accused Tapp of “lack of planning and haphazard communication”, calling the situation unacceptable. Tapp responded: “I find the framing of this absolutely absurd – it is nonsense. There have been years in planning from the officials and ministers. This has been in the public domain for some years. “For those looking to travel for emergencies, there are emergency travel documents, and I urge them to explore that through the government website to see if they are eligible.” The former Conservative cabinet minister David Davis said three of his constituents had only learned about the changes through media reports in the Guardian and the BBC. “I’m going to let him into a little secret here – perhaps that media coverage is as a result of the Home Office’s efforts to get this information out there as widely as we possibly can,” Tapp replied. The Guardian’s reporting was prompted by letters from anxious dual nationals abroad. Since publication, hundreds more readers have contacted the paper saying they were unaware of the rule changes until they saw the coverage."
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:23Z,Two women arrested in Uganda for allegedly kissing in public could face life sentence ,"Two women have been arrested and detained in Uganda after allegedly kissing in public, an act of “same-sex activity” which can lead to a life sentence in the east African country.. Wendy Faith, a 22-year-old musician known as Torrero Bae, and Alesi Diana Denise, 21, were taken into custody after police raided their rented room in Uganda’s north-west Arua City last week. “Information was received from the community that the suspects have been involved in queer and unusual acts believed to be sexual in nature, besides being allegedly seen kissing each other in broad daylight,” said Josephine Angucia, a police spokesperson for the West Nile region, which borders the Democratic Republic of Congo. “It’s further alleged … that many ladies normally converge to stay at the suspects’ residence. It is upon that information that police acted by arresting the two female suspects under the allegation of practicing homosexuality,” she said. The pair have been in custody since their arrest and it is not clear if or when they will formally be charged. Uganda’s autocratic president, Yoweri Museveni, signed the Anti-Homosexuality Act into law in May 2023, amid international and regional outrage. One of the world’s harshest anti-LGBTQ+ laws, it includes life imprisonment for same-sex relationships and the death penalty for “aggravated homosexuality”. Frank Mugisha, executive director, Sexual Minorities Uganda (Smug), said: “We are closely following this case and are deeply alarmed by the arrest of the two young women. This incident is unjust and deeply troubling, and it is not an isolated case. “In recent months, we have seen a sharp and disturbing increase in similar incidents across the country, where people are being reported, targeted, harassed and arrested based solely on allegations about their identity or relationships.” Activists have condemned the growing wave of blackmail and extortion linked to accusations and arrests, which is placing the lives of many LGBTQ+ community members in serious danger, and fuelling fear and insecurity. Mugisha said: “The consequences for these two individuals are severe. They are already being judged and condemned by society, and cases like this send a chilling message to LGBTQ+ people across the country that their safety and dignity are under threat.” The Human Rights Awareness and Promotion Forum reported in January that it had handled 956 cases targeting LGBTQ+ people since the implementation of the law, which affected 1,276 individuals. Ugandan gay rights activist Hans Senfuma said: “The queer community in Uganda right now is not just afraid. We are grieving. We are grieving the freedom we never fully had. We are grieving two young women who did nothing wrong. We are grieving the Uganda we wish existed but does not yet. In April 2024, Uganda’s constitutional court rejected a petition to overturn the bill. “The arrest of Wendy and Diana is not an isolated incident. It is a message, loud, deliberate and brutal, sent to every queer person in Uganda: we are watching you, and we will come for you too,” said Senfuma. “There are thousands of LGBTQI Ugandans who are silently deleting messages from their phones, moving out of shared homes, pulling away from the people they love, rehearsing how to look straight, how to laugh differently, how to survive,” he added. Human Rights Watch in its May 2025 report, Uganda: Anti-LGBT Law Unleashed Abuse, accused authorities in the country of perpetrating widespread discrimination and violence against LGBTQ+ people in the two years since the law was enacted. “We call on the Uganda police and political leaders to immediately stop the surveillance, harassment and targeting of individuals perceived to be LGBTQ Ugandans,” said Mugisha. Senfuma said: “To the international community: do not look away. Do not issue a statement and move on. The funding levers exist. Diplomatic pressure exists. Use them. Two girls are facing life imprisonment. If that does not move you to action, I genuinely do not know what will.”"
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:23Z,"Britain and the US, calm down. The gen Z Chinamaxxers will do you no harm | Coco Khan","As it’s Chinese lunar new year, it would not be surprising if you’ve found yourself scrolling through some China-inspired content. But before you click the heart on a TikTok of paper lanterns or mouthwatering noodles, think twice. As an unsuspecting citizen, you may well be participating in a geopolitical battle where western civilisation itself is on the line. This isn’t the plot of a mediocre action thriller on Amazon Prime – this is “Chinamaxxing”, an internet trend that has got some commentators worrying that gen Z are about to topple the west from the inside. If the word Chinamaxxing looks strangely familiar, it’s because it uses the internet’s suffix du jour, “maxxing”, which roughly translates as “drastic pursuit” of something. Examples include looksmaxxing (improving your looks to an extreme); cloutmaxxing (chasing online influence); and I kid you not, monkmaxxing (extreme self-discipline and isolation). Accordingly, by Chinamaxxing we see TikTokers trying to quickly “become Chinese” through customs and pastimes (qigong stretches, drinking hot water in the morning, learning Mandarin on Duolingo, binge-watching Chinese period dramas etc). “You met me at a very Chinese time in my life,” reads the favoured accompanying caption. And though, sadly, there is the occasional predictably racist post, the vast majority talking of “Chinese baddies” only mean that lovingly (translation: badass). To Chinamaxxing fans themselves, it’s a playful cultural exchange, with some Chinese-American creators noting that after years of feeling excluded because of their differences, it’s touching to see them celebrated. To some critics, this wholesale flattening of an enormous country into little more than a vibe leaves a bitter taste – and seems a bit rich when just a few years ago, east Asian diaspora communities were experiencing so much hostility as they were blamed for Covid. But then it goes further. Even I, a pop-culture lover in my 30s, which, with the pace of current crazes, makes me 1,000-internet-years-old and grants me the prophetic powers of seeing pop culture past, present and all possible futures, was not expecting a TikTok trend to be cast as tantamount to treason. “Chinamaxxing isn’t just a lifestyle trend,” says the New York Post. “Many of the influencers praising Chinese culture are actively denigrating America. They’re aesthetically, morally and politically defecting to another superpower.” Over on Fox News, the conversation discusses this “glamorising of living in communist China” and implores the audience to tell young Americans to love the US. Newsweek takes a softer tone, but also sees the problem. “It makes China an abstraction on to which Americans can project their anxieties about their own country.” Now, it’s fairly obvious why this trend has rattled the American right. Trump may have abandoned the idea of soft power with his cuts to aid, but that does not mean it no longer exists. And culture is a long-established form of soft power. We, as Brits, surely know this better than anyone, given the soft power of American culture. We watch American shows, listen to American music – we feel their joy and pain – and rightly or wrongly, in doing so we also find ourselves more amenable to their brands, their politics, their power. Fortunately for British TikTokers, Chinamaxxing doesn’t trigger the same level of suspicion, which is probably explained by Britain’s more nuanced relationship to China. For sure, young Brits share with American peers a feeling of frustration and disillusionment that their countries are no longer places they feel secure. Across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, there is housing insecurity, with half of adults in their 20s living with their parents. Education debt is growing exponentially, and last week the UK unveiled the highest figures for youth unemployment in more than a decade. So there are reasons to not be cheerful. But does that mean Chinamaxxing is young people yearning for a China takeover? Seems a bit strong for a newly acquired interest in fruit teas. Can we all just take a breath? Perhaps have a Chinamaxxer make us a cuppa. It strikes me that if the right is this worried, and if we genuinely want to make sure young people don’t give up on their nations, a much better use of time would be making sure those nations stop giving up on their young. Instead of hectoring gen Z about not “loving their country” as the rightwing press would like them to, offer them credible pathways to stability, and maybe a fair shot at surpassing – or at least matching – the standards of living enjoyed by their parents. Still, I am grateful that this Chinamaxxing debate has introduced me to the hilariously absurd logic of an aesthetic defection. From Chinamaxxers to the owners of French country-style kitchens: the quislings could be anywhere, apparently. Watch out for them – be vigilant.

2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:23Z,"‘The bathrooms were rank, but we didn’t care’: how the grimy-but-great CBGB changed rock for ever","Fifty years ago, a dive bar in New York’s East Village started to attract attention as a new hub for rock music. Initially, this was a whisper conveyed in a handful of small-circulation music magazines. Then, celebrated musicians, record label executives, hip journalists and photographers, followed by the influencers of that era, began making a beeline for 315 Bowery, the home of CBGB. Inside, an array of young, unknown artists were making music that would change rock’s sound and look, attitude and aesthetic. These outsiders created a template for punk, spoken word, powerpop, new wave, no wave, mutant funk, hardcore and so much more besides. Despite closing its doors two decades ago, CBGB remains a totemic venue in the history of modern music. Now the venue’s heyday is being marked with a four-CD box set that celebrates an era when New York City was cheap to live in, and artistic rather than commercial. The CBGB story centres on Hillel “Hilly” Kristal. Born in New York in 1931 to Russian Jewish immigrants, Kristal served as a marine, sang in folk clubs and then booked artists for the Village Vanguard jazz club, before opening Hilly’s, a Greenwich Village bar featuring live gigs. After neighbours’ complaints about “loud music” forced the venue to close in 1969, he leased 315 Bowery, reasoning no one would complain about noise on New York’s “skid row” – his next-door neighbour, the Palace Hotel, mainly catered to homeless people. Calling the bar Hilly’s on the Bowery, Kristal started by promoting underground jazz concerts, but a motorcycle gang made Hilly’s their Bowery base, scaring off the jazz crowd. Renaming the venue CBGB &amp; OMFUG on 10 December 1973, Kristal envisioned his bar as a roots music venue, its name an acronym for Country, Bluegrass, Blues &amp; Other Music For Uplifting Gourmandizers. Not that Kristal actively pursued this vision, as he was happy to host any musicians who drew a crowd. In early 1974, fledgling rock band Television – led by Tom Verlaine and Richard Hell – requested to play the venue. Despite being initially unimpressed by their stark, angular sound, Kristal gave them a Sunday night residency. For their third gig, Patti Smith and her guitarist/producer Lenny Kaye were in the audience. “That night, Patti and I went to see [concert movie] Ladies &amp; Gentlemen: the Rolling Stones, then took a cab to the Bowery and saw Television,” says Kaye. “It was a changing-of-the-guard moment. Soon we also had a residency at CBGB and, for an epic six weeks, we shared sets with Television. This allowed both bands to develop their ideas and sound – a laboratory of sorts. At the time there were so few places for bands playing original material in New York, so CBGB became a locus of art and energy.” As more bands played CBGB – Kristal booking them based on the dictum “original music only” – a scene began taking shape. Ramones’ CBGB debut on 16 August 1974 found their look – ripped jeans, leather jackets – and fast, sharp songs already in place. After they finished, Kristal told Joey Ramone: “No one is going to like you guys, but I’ll have you back.” Blondie debuted a couple of months later. Patti Smith, with Kaye in her band, played in February 1975. Talking Heads in June. Soon, Mink DeVille would become the house band, and the first issue of Punk magazine, published in January 1976, championed CBGB’s bands. “PUNK is coming!” the magazine’s posters proclaimed and the CBGB scene had a name. “I always think when punk was given a definition in England that it became less of an unpredictable art,” says Kaye. “It had a very specific sound that was somewhat exclusionary to other sounds. And what I like about the ‘punk’ that came out of CBGB is its sensibility. It meant you were starting over, that you were presumptuous to be able to stand up there and say: ‘I’m going to make something new and I’m not going to shy away from it.’” Such notables as Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, John Cale, David Bowie (with bodyguard), Brian Eno and Malcolm McLaren began frequenting CBGB. Seymour and Linda Stein, themselves regular attenders, signed Ramones and Talking Heads to Sire Records. Back in London, McLaren modelled his teenage charges the Sex Pistols on CBGB mainstay Richard Hell (short, spiky hair, ripped T-shirts with slogans, Blank Generation-style anthems). The release of Ramones’ eponymous debut album on 23 April 1976 signalled an uprising and Kristal, aged 45, suddenly found himself a godfather (of sorts) for punk. “What people don’t know about my dad is that he’d studied classical violin, sung in a choir, played folk clubs,” says Lisa Kristal Burgman. “He loved music and wanted to help musicians. That’s why he ran CBGB. And he gave the bands free advice. When Talking Heads invited him to join them on stage at their induction to the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame it was, they said, because Dad helped expand their horizons.” CBGB’s status meant Andy Warhol – often spotted at glitzy disco Studio 54 – could be found rubbing shoulders with rock’n’roll riffraff. Robert Frank and Robert Mapplethorpe dropped in, as did William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, while Divine and John Belushi enjoyed letting out their inner punks by jumping on stage. This intense attention didn’t change Kristal. Photographer Gary Green’s book When Midnight Comes Around documents CBGB from 1976 to 1986 and, even in black-and-white, the photos exude grime, with surfaces covered in graffiti and overflowing ashtrays. “New York was gritty, dirty and poor in those days,” says Green. “And CBGB reflected that.” The club’s toilets were notoriously filthy; here celebrities and music executives experienced punk rock at its most elemental. “The club was bleached every morning,” says Kristal Burgman, who worked at CBGB across 1976 and 77. “It was the clientele who made it messy.” “The bathrooms were never cleaned,” notes Kaye, laughing. “It was gross, but great.” Rising bands now queued to play CBGB. The Damned were the first British band to do so, their 1977 performance introducing UK punk – already a media sensation – to Americans. In 1977 AC/DC and in 1978 the Police made their respective NYC debuts at CBGB; the Oz rockers’ fierce attack stunned jaded New Yorkers, while Sting and co – then unloved and unsuccessful at home – received an enthusiastic response to their 8pm and midnight sets. Beyond the bands who would gain success, CBGB hosted thousands who never experienced fame. Kristal regularly booked four groups a night, and in the 1980s added weekend matinees where hardcore bands would play to underage audiences. Across the decades, Kristal remained seated at the entrance, answering the phone with “CB’s” and dispensing gruff advice. “Hilly was the Buddha of the Bowery,” says Kaye. “He didn’t change things and we loved him for it. He never went upmarket. And that’s a characteristic of a great club owner: he let it happen. He just allowed the energy to find its own direction. That’s what made hanging out in the club so, so exciting – it had that air of unpredictability.” If CBGB didn’t change, New York City did. Gentrification swept through the Bowery, ensuring bankers and boutiques moved in while the corresponding rent increases found Kristal in conflict with his landlord, who claimed he owed $90,000. It went to court and, though Kristal won, he agreed to vacate the premises when his lease ended in 2006. On 15 October 2006, Patti Smith and Lenny Kaye performed until the early hours – during the final number Smith recited a long list of names of CBGB denizens who had died across its 33-year existence. After they left the stage, Kristal locked the venue’s doors and the world’s most celebrated dive bar joined the city’s ghosts. Kristal would soon announce he’d been offered a Las Vegas location to launch a new outpost of CBGB, but he never made it to Nevada – lung cancer claimed him on 28 August 2007. A biopic called CBGB was released in 2013 and starred Alan Rickman as Kristal and Ashley Greene as Lisa – Rickman’s in fine form as punk’s gruff mensch but the film’s script and direction are woefully lacking. Today, CBGB lives on in the fashion line Hilly launched – selling branded clothing and jewellery made him a millionaire – and in a Brooklyn punk-themed festival. Most importantly, CBGB lives on in the music, which is celebrated on CBGB &amp; OMFUG: A New York City Soundtrack 1975-1986, a box set drawing on the club’s halcyon years. From Television and Blondie through to Sonic Youth and Beastie Boys – alongside bands few have heard of (Nihilistics? Marbles? Peroxide?) – it’s a remarkably thorough document, with compiler Rob Tannenbaum noting he played CBGB twice, “and I can assure you the bathrooms were just as rank as they are reputed to have been … We didn’t care – we knew we were standing on sacred ground.” CBGB &amp; OMFUG: A New York City Soundtrack 1975-1986 is out now on Cherry Red Records."
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:23Z,Henderson calls for ‘unity’ as fractious Palace face crucial clash with Zrinjski,"Dean Henderson became a cult hero in south London after saving a penalty in Crystal Palace’s victory against Manchester City in last season’s FA Cup final. The England goalkeeper then boosted his popularity when he dropped into a local pub as supporters celebrated August’s penalty shootout victory over Liverpool in the Community Shield and put £1,000 behind the bar. Henderson, made captain when Marc Guéhi was sold to Manchester City in January after Palace were humbled in the Cup by non-league Macclesfield, must be wondering how things have turned sour at Selhurst Park so quickly. Supporters turned on the manager, Oliver Glasner, during the first leg of the Conference League playoff against Zrinjski Mostar in Bosnia and Herzegovina last week and demanded his sacking after another unconvincing performance in the 1-1 draw. A banner unveiled in the Holmesdale End at the start of Sunday’s 1-0 win against Wolves – only Palace’s second victory in 16 games – took aim at the board and lamented “missed opportunities” since a first major trophy was secured at Wembley last May. It also described Glasner as “finished” after he had told fans to “stay humble”. Glasner was on his best behaviour as he looked ahead to Thursday’s second leg against Zrinjski, having struck another uneasy truce with the Palace chair, Steve Parish, to see out his contract until the end of the season, meaning it was left to Henderson to issue the rallying call. “Unity: I think it’s important that we have that,” Henderson said. “It’s been a difficult period and I think the players have to take a lot of responsibility, because we’ve got to do better, first and foremost. For whatever reason it was, we had too many injuries and we just couldn’t cope with the amount of games and the quality we were up against in the Premier League over the last couple of months. “Now we’ve got everyone back and we’ve got a squad, we’ve been picking up some good results, so hopefully that can give the club a boost. We’re playing European football … and it should be a time for everyone to come together and enjoy that.” Henderson added: “It’s time to shift the narrative and really smile and enjoy these moments because they don’t come round often, instead of putting all the negative spin on everything.” One of Glasner’s gripes after the first leg was that some of his players have had their eyes on their next move – an accusation many Palace fans will feel applies to him too. Jean-Philippe Mateta, who Glasner expects back soon from the knee injury that scuppered his January move to Milan, Adam Wharton, Daniel Muñoz and the out-of-contract Daichi Kamada are among those linked with summer moves. Henderson, who is expected to be Jordan Pickford’s backup at the World Cup, warned anyone not committed to the cause they were in for a rude awakening. “If you don’t put the performances in order, you don’t get the move you want, so they need to be very careful,” he said. “I’m not aware of any of that, but I would suggest they have to be careful if they were thinking like that.” Wharton’s form in particular has dipped in recent weeks but Glasner pointed out that the England midfielder had already played more than 1,000 minutes more than he had last season, owing to Palace’s involvement in the Conference League. “Players have to cope with a completely new situation in their career,” he said. “I remember I spoke to Eddie Howe at Newcastle when they played the first time in the Champions League. They were massively struggling and I spoke about his experience. But we are still the second-best amount of points ever [at this stage for Palace]. “We have the European competitions and we have had some big injury problems at the end of last year. We had the Afcon [Africa Cup of Nations], we had some big noise in any single transfer window, and when I see the big picture, everything that happened for me, it’s just incredible where we are right now.” Palace are three points behind eighth-placed Bournemouth in the Premier League and Glasner insists whoever replaces him could be competing in Europe again next season. He won the Europa League in 2022 with Eintracht Frankfurt before falling out with the hierarchy the following season despite reaching the German Cup final and is aiming to reach a fourth final in five seasons. But, perhaps wisely given Palace’s difficulty in breaking down low blocks, he was wary of making the bold prediction that Palace can go all the way before Zrinjski’s visit. “I think for 120 years Crystal Palace entered every cup competition to win it,” he said. “This group of players has done it once last year. Every team will enter the competition, but just one can leave with the trophy at the end, and it just makes no sense to talk now about it.”"

The principles are the result of a collaboration between the charity and more than 45 industry organisations, including all the public service broadcasters, studios, leading streamers, production companies and trade unions. They come after the charity’s Looking Glass survey found an increase in mental health struggles across the UK film and TV industry, with 35% of respondents describing their mental health as “poor” or “very poor”. About 30% of respondents also said they had experienced suicidal thoughts in the previous 12 months, 63% said their work had a negative effect on their mental health and 64% had considered leaving the industry due to concerns about mental health. The nine principles outline the core actions any production would need to take to ensure support for mental health is positively and routinely embedded. They include creating a culture that supports wellbeing; fostering respectful, inclusive relationships across teams; managing the impact of difficult subject matter; and managing workload. Marcus Ryder, chief executive of the Film and TV charity, said the guidance marked “the biggest industry initiative to address mental health in film and television in a generation”. “The evidence shows that mental health outcomes for those working in film and TV are consistently worse than national averages,” Ryder told the Guardian. “Since 2019, our research has found significantly higher levels of stress, burnout, loneliness and poor mental wellbeing across the sector. “This isn’t about individuals being less resilient. It’s about the systemic impact of working conditions, culture across the industry and the capability of the industry as a whole to deal with these issues.” Ryder said the principles meant thinking about mental health in the same practical way productions already think about physical safety. This may mean “identifying potential stress risks at the planning stage”, planning ahead for “emotionally challenging content or difficult filming environments” and putting clear processes in place for reporting bullying or inappropriate behaviour. While the principles themselves are not regulations, they are grounded in existing legal duties and best practice, Ryder said. How they are implemented will vary. “Some partners may encourage adoption; others may embed them more formally into commissioning frameworks or production requirements,” he added. Existing frameworks that address workplace mental health more broadly include the UK health and safety law and international standards such as ISO 45003, which focuses on psychological health and safety at work. Within the screen sector, organisations such as the Creative Industries Independent Standards Authority have introduced standards around behaviour and misconduct, and many broadcasters and production companies have their own policies and guidance. “What hasn’t existed until now is a single, industry-backed framework that brings all of this together and translates it into practical, production-specific guidance,” Ryder said. “Film and television production environments are unique; they are freelance, fast-moving, and often high-pressure. Generic workplace guidance doesn’t always map neatly on to those realities.” Sara Putt, Bafta chair and Film and TV charity chair, said: “Across every stage of a screen-industry career, our Bafta talent programme participants and members tell us the same thing. Instability of freelance jobs, lack of access to training and skills development, the realities of production working conditions and pressures from fewer job opportunities are not only driving a talent drain, but also having a profound impact on the mental health and wellbeing of our workforce.” Kate Phillips, chief content officer at the BBC, called it a “potential watershed moment for the UK creative sector’s duty of care to its production community”. She encouraged the BBC’s in-house production teams and third-party suppliers to prioritise the principles, “so that people working right across the industry can benefit – and so the industry itself can be stronger, healthier, and more sustainable as a result.”"
2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:22Z,You be the judge: should my girlfriend change the way she loads the dishwasher?,"The prosecution: Emily There is a correct way to load a dishwasher. Ananya’s haphazard method makes no sense I don’t really fight with my partner, Ananya, except over this: I believe there is a correct way to load and unload a dishwasher, and she flatly refuses to agree. Ananya doesn’t rinse plates before she loads them. It only takes two seconds to run something under the tap, but she doesn’t. Then there’s the way she puts things in. In most dishwashers, the water is sprayed up from the bottom. Bowls need to go in upside down, otherwise water never reaches the insides properly and you end up with crockery full of dirty water that can’t drain out. Similarly, dishes shouldn’t be stacked on top of each other. It’s basic physics. But Ananya piles plates on top of each other and shoves cups wherever. She throws all the cutlery into one compartment, facing upwards, when they should face down to get washed more. Things come out dirty, or with water pooled on top. She takes the dirty dishes to the sink to wash by hand afterwards. She blames the dishwasher, but it’s really how she’s using it. I grew up in a house without a dishwasher, but when I moved into a shared house I learned that dishes can’t be just shoved in any which way. Plates should not be crammed together, bowls should be angled, and glasses have to go on the top rack so they don’t crack. Ananya has broken glasses before because she puts them upside down in the bottom rack. I’m always the one who fixes the problems she causes. I often have to reload the dishwasher and switch it back on to do another wash. I’m also the only one who cleans the filter. When I suggest she should load the dishwasher my way, she accuses me of being pedantic or says it’s “not a big deal”. I don’t think wanting clean dishes is controlling. We both suffer if one of us loads it badly: we end up eating off dirty plates or replacing broken crockery. Ananya says there’s no “right way” to load dishwashers, just different preferences. But they are machines designed to be used in a specific way and you can’t just hope for the best. The defence: Ananya My method works fine. By dictating how it should be done, Emily is being superior and controlling Emily treats the dishwasher like a moral test: if you don’t load it her way, you’ve failed, not just at the task, but as a person and as a girlfriend. I didn’t grow up with a dishwasher, either, so I’m used to washing everything by hand. I reject Emily’s claim that I’m not good at washing-up. Before I lived with her, my dishes were always clean. I like using the dishwasher, but I’m not anal about it. To me, it is a convenience, not a sacred system. I load what fits, turn it on, and get on with my life. If I’m in a rush, I do shove the lot in wherever, but it always comes out more or less clean. Yes, sometimes a glass will still have a bit of residue, so I will hand rinse it, which takes 10 seconds. The world keeps turning. Emily constantly redoes my work, sighing theatrically and calling me in to observe her following her superior method. She constantly talks about the correct ways of doing things as if they are objective facts. The only thing I’ve taken on board is placing the bowls face-down. But I don’t really rinse things off because I don’t have time. What’s the point in having a dishwasher if you have to wash things first? Emily says the filter gets clogged if I don’t, but so far it’s been fine. The cutlery also still comes out clean if I put the forks facing up, so this is a non-issue. The glasses broke because they were old, not because of how I positioned them. Emily is the type of person to read the manual of an electronics item when it arrives: I just go for it. But that doesn’t automatically make her way the only acceptable way. She just has a superiority complex. She frames her way of doing things as practical, when it’s clearly about control. She is a teacher, and there is a seven-year age gap between us – so maybe that’s why we have this disagreement. I don’t refuse to learn her tactics because I’m lazy or careless: I honestly don’t think there’s anything wrong with what I’m doing. The jury of Guardian readers Does Ananya’s argument lack sparkle? Many people have elaborate dishwasher stacking rules, but Ananya isn’t even doing the basics – rinsing and stacking upside down. “More or less clean” is another way of saying “dirty”. And Ananya says the filter is fine, but that’s only because Emily is cleaning it. Rachel, 45 Ananya and Emily are both double-washing, wasting water, energy and time. When it is her turn, Ananya should skip the machine entirely and wash up by hand. Lou, 43 Even if Ananya doesn’t care about reading manuals or dealing with dirty or broken dishes, Emily clearly does – and when you’re in a relationship, you need to take your partner’s feelings into account. Why not let Emily be in charge of dishes, so she can do it her way, and have Ananya take charge of another chore that is less contentious? Jasmeen, 38 I would politely send my regrets to any dinner parties Ananya is hosting. Some things in life don’t matter, but hygiene certainly does. Ananya’s scathing response speaks for itself. Mona, 52 What’s the point of having a dishwasher if you’re not going to use it efficiently? Maybe Emily could convey her feelings less patronisingly, but if she’s having to clear up Ananya’s messes, she’s still in the right. Perhaps Ananya should go back to washing her own dishes by hand. Susie, 46 Now you be the judge In our online poll, tell us: does Ananya need to clean up her act?

2026-02-26,2026-02-26T08:00:22Z,Norway’s all-conquering Winter Olympians have a message for us all – and it’s not what you think | Cath Bishop,"Norway’s Olympians stormed the mountains of Milano Cortina and left the rest of the world wondering how a nation of 5.6 million people regularly tops the Winter Olympics medal table, this year winning 18 gold medals and 41 medals overall. They’re not bad at the Summer Olympics either, despite not playing to their obvious national geographical strengths, winning four gold medals and a total of eight medals in Paris 2024. But all this talk of medals detracts from looking more closely at what the Norwegians do to create one of the best and most sustainable sports systems in the world. Reports have highlighted that there is no competitive sport in Norway for youngsters before the age of 12. Now think of all of Britain’s early talent-identification schemes, endless mini-leagues and ubiquitous “pathways”. Consider all those extra practices to secure the next trophy, anxous discussions about rankings, disappointment over selection decisions and the “devastating losses” on a weekend that should just be another ordinary yet fun day in a child’s life. Remember also the army of volunteers required to adjudicate, select and keep score in sport, rather than support, encourage and spread joy. Norway has a national youth sports strategy based on the vision of “Joy of Sport for All”. There isn’t one herein the UK. There is a national sports strategy with the strapline “Get Active”, which feels more of a reprimand than an inspiring vision. While it’s true that sport and physical activity are mentioned in the new National Youth Strategy, it’s so buried within the generic text that I couldn’t find or feel the joy of sport coming through at all. Let’s just dream for a moment. What if every youth coach, sports club volunteer, club leader – and let’s add in PE teachers too – had one overarching goal in their role description and annual aims? It could be a single principle underlying why they turn up each week, underpinning every conversation with a child entrusted to them: to create an experience of joy. What might be different? What might we gain or lose? What assumptions would that challenge? It’s not that coaches and clubs don’t want to create joyous experiences, it’s just that there seem to be other priorities. The simplicity and clarity of the Norwegian youth sport system liberates them from archaic tropes that still seem prevalent in our system. The Norwegians even feel comfortable -– trigger warning – giving trophies out to every kid! That’s an idea I’ve only seen ridiculed in the UK, dismissed as “not real life”, soft, embarrassing, pathetic. It’s usually cited as the ultimate vindication for competitive sport, ironically. Any slight shift towards sports festivals and greater enjoyment is undermined by a searing: “You’ll be suggesting everyone gets a trophy next.” Except, yes. That is what the mighty, heroic, mountain-conquering Norwegians do. They both happily give all children trophies as they grow up and at the same time deliver indomitable Olympic performances like we saw before us on the Livigno mountains. What the Norwegians know – and we either miss or consider optional – is that the most important thing is that children enjoy sport and come back again and again. Norway plays the long game, proving that it isn’t essential to learn from the age of five that “sport is tough, to succeed you have to suffer”. In so doing they demonstrate that truly resilient adults, including elite athletes, are best forged from a childhood full of thriving experiences of sport. Johannes Høsflot Klæbo won six gold medals at Milano Cortina and now has 11 golds in all, but only started in the performance system at 15 having enjoyed a range of sports growing up. In the UK we give out godlike status for less than half as many gold medals – you really wonder if we are going soft … Norwegian children are not pressured into specialising too young: early bloomers are not favoured over others who blossom later, and the system invests consistently to ensure access to all. Schools have winter ski days and families ski together on the weekends. They avoid the damaging separation of children into those with “talent” and those traumatised by dropping the ball and being left out of teams. UK reports show fewer than half of all children get a basic amount of daily exercise with rapidly increasing drop-out rates before reaching adulthood. In Norway, 90% of young children are active, and though it decreases, it’s still more than 70% for teenagers. Tore Øvrebø, Norway’s much-interviewed director of elite sport, questions why other sporting systems focus more on getting rid of young people than developing them. “The biggest motivation for kids to do sports is that they do it with their friends and they have fun,” he says. Research in the UK shows that the biggest reason why kids drop out is it stops being fun. It’s really that simple. Back to imagining: more play and creativity, more time for developing skills and a wider range of movements and coordination, stronger team experiences and growing competence in building social connections. By being less competitive, something we seem almost afraid of considering, Norwegian children learn about sport much more effectively. That’s what we might describe as the paradox of the Norwegian approach, although to them, it’s just common sense. A Norwegian friend now living in London – naturally just back from a few days cross-country skiing – told me the press were going wild about all the medals back home. They both love those hard-fought medals and at the same time realise it’s a mug’s game to run youth sport like that. Our pyramids and pathways mislead us. We have driven a deep divide between the ideas of sport for fun and “serious competitive sport” as if it’s an essential life truth. Every coach and sports leader should see it as their personal duty to undo this fiction. We need to design a national youth sports strategy around human flourishing, not suffering. Coaching courses should help coaches figure out what’s required for children to want to come back and play sport throughout their childhood and adult lives. It’s the ultimate win-win: if we helped every child to love sport, we would get both better athletes and healthier humans. Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?
